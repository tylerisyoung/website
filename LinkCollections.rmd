<h1>**Link Collections from Raindrop**</h1> 
<h6>
***Raindrop.io allows users to quickly save and share links from any device or app that are also saved and categorized for later. I've used it for years to save hundreds of links which I can now share here with you. Many of them are random and fleeting thoughts as is the nature of social media, but there are also some serious and sometimes controversial topics listed below. Browse at your own risk and enjoyment!***
