<strong>Joe Biden and our loss in Sensemaking.</strong>

<h3>
How America’s fundamental pillars of sensemaking have fallen to rhetorical fallacies, resulting in identity based movements that hurt the very people they aim to help.
</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p>As liberals go back to their brunch, some people wonder why Biden almost lost, thinking there’s a growing number of racists in America, and they would be right.</p>
<p>Problem is; The racists who are growing in number are those pushing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics">Identity Politics</a>, and post modernist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory">Critical Race Theory</a>. While this is true, I do not fault the majority supporters of movements like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200714082520/https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/08/24/i-was-a-civil-rights-activist-in-the-1960s-but-its-hard-for-me-to-get-behind-black-lives-matter/">Black Lives Matter</a>, or the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/may/24/editorial-1619-project-bad-history-fueled-bad-moti/">1619 Project</a>, for posting the black square, <a href="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/782dad788e4144aea49e4a4a352b4c95/960x0.jpg?fit=scale">taking a knee</a>, and raising a <a href="https://twitter.com/DineshDSouza/status/1298320532551667712">fist</a> because I’m certain that supporters, the <a href="https://freewestmedia.com/2020/06/27/pew-research-majority-blm-protesters-are-white-democrats/">majority of which</a> are white liberals,are just plainly unaware of the complex rhetoric, and underlying Postmodernist and Marxist values, which either falls prey to relativism or authoritarian enforcement, the new left is not aware of this,but the far left is, and I blame the media.</p>
<p>Captured by corporate money, 90% of news outlets who are <a href="bit.ly/3mZt1ei">owned by 6 multinational corporations</a> have only one task which is vying for rage clicks based on fear, fomo, and outrage to maintain engagement, sell advertisements, and collect user data to sell more products. Ask the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iB3gM4TUgg&amp;t=3m50s">owner of CBS</a> or the <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/414390-cnn-boss-if-we-break-from-trump-coverage-the-audience-goes-away">President of CNN</a> or any number of <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/510411-msnbc-producer-pens-scathing-exit-letter-ratings-model-blocks-diversity-of">former employees</a>. Even independent media outlets like The Intercept have succumb to false narratives like <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Russiagate">Russiagate</a> and lost <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/29/glenn-greenwald-quits-the-intercept-over-hunter-biden-article/">good reporters</a> because of it. I admit to doing some of this here as well, though I stand by my claims in what I perceive to be a more honorable way.</p>
<p>So why then, does the New York times and the majority of the media who <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Manufacturing-Consent-Political-Economy-Media/dp/0375714499/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=manufacturing+consent&amp;sr=8-2">cater their rhetoric to white college educated liberals</a> (who have money to spend on marketing campaigns), and reporters across outlets that consistently <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3279453">consult on stories with management, more than their outside sources</a>, do they insist on telling their base that Trump, his supporters, and all political opponents, even those criticizing the Dems <a href="https://jakubferencik.medium.com/the-controversy-of-bret-weinstein-explained-the-evergreen-scandal-f3dfe07b1d70">squarely from the left</a>, or as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/intellectual-dark-web.html">political outsiders</a> are: Alt Right, Bigots and <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/new-york-times-meeting-transcript.html">irredeemably racist</a>?</p>
<p>The New York Times gets the news wrong on purpose for the same reason that seven democratic candidates (Steyer, Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Warren, Yang, Buttigieg, and Harris) all dropped out, and within 10 days endorsed the establishment candidate: Joe Biden. All at a critical moment in March when Sanders was about to lock in his win of the Democratic primaries.</p>
<p>This was alongside Obama, who came out of retirement to organize this endorsement, along with a few other retiree honorable mentions in order for him to save face and continue support for the establishment. Obama, who was given the names for his own cabinet in an an email from the third largest bank in America - Citigroup, which was revealed by <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/10/15/wiki-o15.html">Wikileaks</a> similar to the Clintons, so he could later <a href="https://archive.attn.com/stories/7926/president-obama-jokes-about-working-for-goldman-sachs">work as an advisor to Goldman Sachs</a>. Obama also chose to help with the medias cover up of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trey-gowdy-why-susan-rice-email-is-the-most-bizarre-thing-ive-read">Obamagate</a> (where we found out <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/04/29/explosive-new-flynn-documents-show-fbi-goal-was-to-get-him-fired/">Obama and the FBI knew they were entrapping Michael Flynn</a>) by ‘<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/09/obama-michael-flynn-call/">leaking</a>’ a phone call, in addition to telling Lebron James to get back to the court thus ending the NBA’s strike after a single day and zero gains for the players or their stated mission of racial justice, and finally, to endorse his former VP, Joe Biden over the vastly more popular Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>Obama was the perfect establishment candidate for the out to brunch liberals paying no attention to policy. Policy doesn’t matter much when you’re upper middle class, and he had the added bonus of his oratory skills to pay lip service to the left while <a href="https://nypost.com/2013/10/31/obama-health-care-law-modeled-after-mitt-romneys-plan/">implementing Mitt Romney’s right wing healthcare plan</a>, dropping <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/09/america-dropped-26171-bombs-2016-obama-legacy">more bombs than Bush</a>, deporting <a href="https://thehill.com/latino/470900-deportations-lower-under-trump-than-obama-report">more immigrants than Trump</a> (<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obamas-deportation-policy-numbers/story?id=41715661">or any previous president</a>), building the cages that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/maddow-shows-photos-of-caged-illegal-immigrants-during-obama-administration-to-criticize-trump-border-separation-policy">Rachel Maddow incorrectly attributed</a> to Trump, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/31/chelsea-manning-us-torture-un-official-wikileaks">torturing Chelsea Manning</a> who would not help build a case against Assange for exposing war crimes who <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/11/the-u-s-governments-indictment-of-julian-assange-poses-grave-threats-to-press-freedoms/">Obama mostly left alone and Trump has renewed the prosecution of</a>, he charged Snowden <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/03/flashback-obamas-war-on-whistleblowers-more-prosecuted-as-spies-than-ever-before/">under the espionage act</a> for revealing illegal mass surveillance of our own people, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-obama-at-war/">starting 5 new wars</a> after running on disengagement and a move away from global policing, opening the arctic to oil and gas drilling - <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/here-s-why-obama-is-approving-arctic-drilling-again/">twice</a>…and lastly <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-where-those-who-lost-homes-during-the-us-housing-crisis-are-now-2018-8?op=1">kicking millions out of their homes</a> while bailing out banks - in an unprecedented way - in 2008 under a <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/resetting-the-bomb">similar economic crisis</a>.</p>
<p>I do not disparage the Democrats because I prefer republicans, I consider myself closest to the progressive side of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism">classic liberalism</a>, and I aim to point out the remaining blind spots of corruption that the media consistently and conveniently leaves out as they toe the line between pandering to the left, condemning critics, and manufacturing consent for their Wallstreet owners bidding on foreign wars. While the traditional media clings to its current form and practices, and while we have (I believe only briefly) lost our ability for collective sensemaking, it is very possible that the establishment democrats are; If not the lesser evil, certainly the more insidious evil. Donald Trump would never be able to do the things Obama did because the world is eagerly watching his every move waiting to denounce him as a ‘fascist’.</p>
<p>In order to <a href="https://www.libertynation.com/hillary-clinton-barack-obama-brought-back-slavery-libya/">start a slave trade in Libya</a>, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-problem-from-hell-the-u_b_8090782">participate in a genocide</a> in Yemen, and attempt to overthrow the popular candidates in <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/07/23/the-u-s-supported-coup-in-bolivia-continues-to-produce-repression-and-tyranny-while-revealing-how-u-s-media-propaganda-works/">Bolivia</a> and <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/john-bolton-admits-us-backed-coup-venezuela-oil-not-democracy/5667083">Venezuela</a> for natural resources straight from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocolonialism">Neocolinialism</a> playbook, in order to install U.S. friendly right wing dictators who will privatize oil for the <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2018/02/16/canada-vs-venezuela-have-the-koch-brothers-captured-canadas-left/">Koch Brothers’ Texas refinery</a>, the citizens of America must remain ignorant and misinformed for this to occur under Obama’s eight and Pelosi’s 17 year reign. I truly believe that most people, regardless of political affiliation, would be against many of these practices carried out behind closed doors which often affect those most vulnerable both in our country and abroad. True social justice does not stop at the border.</p>
<p>In four years, or eight, or even sixteen, if we’re not careful, we will have one of two things forced on voters, either a candidate on the left who is willing to carry out authoritarian methods of implementing equity in America in the name of social justice, or a worse Donald Trump who doesn’t send mean tweets but is actually competent enough to carry out the things CNN claims he is doing on a daily basis, while paying lip service to social justice issues to score points with the media.</p>
<p>Sellout democratic candidates like; Warren, who completely <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2020/02/20/elizabeth-warren-super-pac-accept/">flipped her stance</a> on taking money from corporate donors, after figuring she would loose but still wanted to play nice with the establishment so <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2020/06/17/warren-flips-on-big-fundraisers-for-biden-event-raising-6-million">hosted</a> many high dollar corporate fundraisers for Biden, or Harris, who <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/467704-harris-i-knew-id-be-called-a-flip-flopper-on-medicare-for-all">also flipped</a> on medicare for all, and was sued three times before releasing inmates from overcrowded prisons because she <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kamala-harris-ag-office-tried-to-keep-inmates-locked-up-for-cheap-labor">addmitedly wanted to use them for cheap labour</a> to fight fires in CA while <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/10/hundreds-of-california-inmates-helping-to-fight-wildfires/">earning between $2 and $5 per day</a>, because her and the rest of our elected leaders are just empty politicians who stand for thing but money and power, though Harris does remain a useful and passably intersectional vessel for the democratic establishment’s dreams of tax cuts and military intervention. These people are not your friends, they are elected leaders we should be demanding more from. Even Sanders, <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/11/why-bernie-sanders-lost/">pulling his punches at every turn</a> losing him the election which was his for the taking, or Yang now working for CNN, and even the primary candidate I voted for: Tulsi Gabbard who ultimately endorsed Joe Biden and voted for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/30/848321204/how-the-cares-act-became-a-tax-break-bonanza-for-the-rich-explained">the largest upward transfer of wealth in American history</a> alongside “The Squad” including AOC, Ro Khanna, Illhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley. Whom all also voted to impeach on ridiculous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/28/trump-russia-investigation-mueller-liberal-media-rachel-maddow">Russiagate</a> nonsense that had already been <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/04/18/robert-mueller-did-not-merely-reject-the-trumprussia-conspiracy-theories-he-obliterated-them/">debunked</a> - <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/05/14/new-documents-from-the-sham-prosecution-of-gen-michael-flynn-also-reveal-broad-corruption-in-the-russiagate-investigations/">over</a> and <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/russiagate-is-wmd-times-a-million">over</a> - by <a href="https://ithacavoice.com/2019/04/independent-journalism-highlighted-with-annual-izzy-awards/">award winning</a> <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/rip-russiagate/">articles</a> which only <a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/matt-taibbi-and-aaron-mate-on-how-russiagate-helped-trump/">helped Trump</a> nearly win reelection in 2020.</p>
<p>I respected Tulsi for similar reasons to why I respect <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/27/coronavirus-thomas-massie-slammed-trump-congress-over-vote-stance/2924640001/">Thomas Massie</a>, for standing alone in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment">Stanford Prison Experiment</a>. Out of 535 members of congress, she was the only one to abstain from voting on the political circus that was impeachment over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal">Ukrainegate</a>, which was a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/whistleblower-ukraine-trump-impeach-cia-spying-895529/">nonstarter issue in the first place</a>, but not to be confused with the more legitimate duopolistic Wallstreet establishment type general corruption that was Joe Biden’s <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/10/09/joe-hunter-biden-family-money/">involvement in Burisma</a> with his son Hunter Biden, also culminating in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/30/twitter-backs-down-agrees-to-unlock-posts-account/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow">censorship story</a> of a <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/with-the-hunter-biden-expose-suppression-136">lifetime</a>. But if there’s any public perception interference over our elections, it’s definitely Russia and their spending a few thousand dollars on Facebook ads and <a href="https://thegrayzone.com/2017/10/23/russian-facebook-memes-american-foreign-policy/">sub par memes</a> garnering a whopping 3 million views at the time on their most popular post featuring an explication of “what it means for food to be halal.”</p>
<p>Do I need to put a disclaimer here stating that obviously Donald trump is corrupt as well? Frankly I think the mainstream media has that lane sufficiently taken, albeit doing a rather poor job at calling him out on things that actually matter like the military spending budget, tax cuts, and corporate bailouts, because of course the Dems want those things too.</p>
<p>What is the point of not taking any corporate money if you continue to vote with corporate money? Why do the corporate Democrats <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/donna-brazile-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders">want Bernie to loose more than they care if Trump wins</a>, and what exactly, explains the <a href="https://www.bizpacreview.com/2020/03/04/tulsi-blackout-continues-dnc-says-debate-threshold-will-go-up-after-gabbard-already-reached-it-893864">Tulsi</a> and the more pronounced <a href="https://vocal.media/theSwamp/a-visual-history-of-the-yang-media-blackout">Yang media Blackout</a>? The answer is unfortunately the same for all politicians and corporate media: Money and Power.</p>
<p>Politicians and corporations, along with academia and our institutions, which together comprise Americas collective sense-making apparatus are all currently failing us -not entirely- but predominantly because of their own zero sum elite game theory which was recently blindsided by the post modernists that comprise a small but loud portion of the new left in which I believe the pendulum has swung too far towards, practically leading to another Donald Trump victory.</p>
<p>The woke left has adopted <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/2020/06/reasons-critical-race-theory-terrible-dealing-racism/">insidious and irresistible rhetoric</a> to apply pressure to these four entities in hopes of gaining power via the intersectional oppression metrics in the name of the (<a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/which-is-the-real-working-class-party">former</a>) working class party, only to shame voters and fellow citizens if they prefer to site statistics and are fired for it, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/7/29/21340308/david-shor-omar-wasow-speech">as a prime example of cancel culture</a>. To resist any demands put forth by the woke left, often comprised of internet <a href="https://twitter.com/Indian_Bronson/status/1318211892909907974">pile-ons</a>, or real life rioting and destruction as <a href="https://twitter.com/Dilan_Smithee/status/1317953464106950657">detailed very well by CNN</a> and egged on by the corporate media, continuing to chase anything that will <a href="https://twitter.com/clairlemon/status/1317313378973409280">incite rage clicks</a> to make money including siding with bad actors like; BLM organizers, Ibram X Kendi, or Robin DiAngelo whom all incite either divisive guilt, or rage for ones self or the ‘other’ to manufacture cult like mobs comprised of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot">Useful Idiots</a> who are unfortunately manipulated to think anyone who disagrees with them is a racist, a bigot, a transphobe, a Terf, an apologist, and beyond the pale. It is too bad these mobs are <a href="https://twitter.com/KatieBailey_DC/status/1299314283180949504">never able to get anything right</a>, so why do organizers use them to demand things, rather than propose legislation in the agreed upon way? Because mobs work.</p>
<p>Everything from toppling statues, to raising a fist, and posting a black square, advocating for #BlackTranslivesmatter (transgender folks are the ‘least accepted’ by society as whole so they generally sit atop the throne of woke theory) this is becoming increasingly harder to resist as the dynamics of the political and social versions of the Stanford Prison Experiment play out. White Guilt - <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=926110097116068010125099120093023092029042041058054022096075004072105099108071083081035042057063112008038072089018127023097096031044060037085069090120122004127100102067055021027094029078126008122028067071066102122066069071067125113084087021084077125122&amp;EXT=pdf">which can reinforce actual white supremacy</a>, Rage - <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.2402v1.pdf">which fosters the best engagement on social media</a>, and community forced compliance - as demonstrated by black squares, fists, and kneeling, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fc34Hes9YA&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;t=1m28s/?target=_blank">which have all gone too far</a>, are powerful motivators, especially when followers are asked to ignore statistics in favor of ‘lived experience’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFSEStq7Kww/?target=_blank">this is religion</a> and organizers of movements <a href="https://msu.edu/~pennock5/courses/484%20materials/harding-standpoint-strong-objectivity.pdf">know this</a>!</p>
<p>It is not a large number of motivated organizers that are necessary to implement policy that seemingly large groups are supporting, and this is done through use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy">Motte &amp; Bailey</a> rhetorical and argumentative tactics, which propose a moderate and understandable position like “reform”, or “Defund the police” when the true ask comes out after the initial agreement to the reasonable position and then only later becomes the more extreme position of “Abolish the police,” in order to perpetuate further chaos which gives way to structural regime chnage towards Marxism in the United States. This is used widely across new left movements and predominantly used when arguments, justifications, and outcomes cannot withstand scrutiny.</p>
<p>Do I really need to put a disclaimer here that says I don’t care what your race is, where you’re from, or what your gender identity, pronouns, or biological sex are, only that I fundamentally disagree with a nonzero portion of the left using these things to foster an artificial scale of oppression where the most oppressed get the policies they want without consideration for facts, data, or long term consequences? No, that was obvious? Okay good.</p>
<p>Movement organizers are consistently trained in poorly thought out <a href="https://msu.edu/~pennock5/courses/484%20materials/harding-standpoint-strong-objectivity.pdf">postmodernist tactics</a> and Marxism, which I propose do not contradict today’s woke left. The founders of Black Lives Matter <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/blm-co-founder-describes-herself-as-trained-marxist/">admit</a> they are trying to implement Marxism in the United States. The same founders want to destroy the nuclear family which they have <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/24/blm-removes-website-language-blasting-nuclear-family-structure/">since removed</a> this rhetoric from their site in order to not offend anyone while simultaneously not changing their views, but continuing to get the largest number of people out into the streets with a cunningly deceptive use of things like Deangelo’s “White Guilt” all in order to posture for political power, and pandering to a social justice narrative while actually <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dobbin/files/dobbin_-_aatraining_clean.pdf">implementing regressive policy</a>.</p>
<p>This newfound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory">Critical Race Theory</a>, and its advocating for the previous items, plus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190313140801/https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kamala-harris-and-elizabeth-warren-are-wrong-we-shouldnt-pay-reparations-for-slavery/2019/02/26/8cbf9c66-39fa-11e9-a06c-3ec8ed509d15_story.html">reparations</a>, trans women in <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2020/10/16/trans-lives-matter-joe-biden-transgender-athletes-equality-act-girls-sports/">women’s sports</a> and <a href="https://thefederalist.com/2019/06/28/california-legislature-passes-bill-put-trans-men-womens-prisons-even-rapists/">prisons</a>, the <a href="https://thecritic.co.uk/j-k-rowling-is-not-transphobic-people-who-menstruate-are-women/">canceling of J.K. Rowling</a> among others, abandoning the former liberal position of free speech in favor of censorship by media conglomerates, and affirmative action based on the color of ones skin, rather than true merit, or the content of ones character.</p>
<p>I have some real problems with some of these things that I believe need investigation and answering before definitive policy based action is taken, which we did see some of, where Prop 16 recently failed on the ballot in my home state of California, because average people who want to live their lives in average ways do not care about, or agree with any of this nonsense, and they realize that it’s coming from the left.</p>
<p>These average Americans are definitely not racists or bigots either, and if you believe that large swaths of America are, I would encourage you to talk to people in real life, people you meet, make an assessment as to how racist you think they are, then see what they think about any of these things. I’m willing to bet that they do not agree with initiatives like <a href="https://www.independentsentinel.com/1619-project-a-radical-version-of-us-history-is-mandated-in-some-schools/">mandatory education of</a> the 1619 Project in schools, or Prop 16 which has already played out by NY University who is <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2020/11/07/race-n07.html">revamping segregation</a> in undergraduate dormitories because “Black identifying students” need “safe spaces,” the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200719154634/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/arts/music/blind-auditions-orchestras-race.html">NY Philharmonic</a> who has historically aimed to judge people by their musical talent wants to return to judging them by race. This is all because anti racism is actually just still racism, and while representation does matter, individual interests will differ, and we need not handicap our best and brightest in order to make room for diversity, and we especially do not need to be telling anyone that they are somehow not as good as their peers regardless of the reason.</p>
<p>This is all straight out of NYT Best Seller, <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/White-Fragility-People-About-Racism/dp/0807047414/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=white+fragility&amp;qid=1604775852&amp;sr=8-3">“White Fragility” by Robin DiAngelo</a>, and it is entirely predicated on dehumanization and condescension of black people as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/dehumanizing-condescension-white-fragility/614146/">John McWhorter explains</a>. It still amazes folks that there are biological temperament predispositions which lead to a disproportionate number of male engineers and female nurses as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jan/18/educationsgendergap.genderissues">explained by the president of Harvard</a>. Our aim should be to remove barriers holding back the under achievers, not place more barriers in front of those doing well. Average people fundamentally know this, and are not inherently racist or bigoted for thinking so. They likely believe in equality of opportunity, and not equality of outcome (equity) as <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1322963321994289154">hilariously confused by Kamala Harris</a>, but most people can’t keep up with the rhetoric, don’t have the time or interest to invest in the latest political ‘bombshell’ the Times drops, because most people are generally nice no matter who they voted for. Almost everyone I’ve ever met or heard of in my life wants a better society with less inequality from race or class.</p>
<p>It is important to consider why Donald Trump won, and almost won again. BAlongside Obama, Joe Biden has a worse record than Trump. The idea that he is the opposite, and an antidote to Trump is ridiculous, and we need to ask ourselves if we want to fight a sheep in wolves clothing, or a wolf in wolves clothing. Either way the American people have been collectively turned to the cattle of the media and fed to the wolves. Why are everyday Americans virtue signaling their vote for the lesser of two evils, because they actually believe this, or because they are tired of and annoyed by Trumps bombastic lies and mean tweets which are mostly inconsequential as he is truly the village idiot in a world of corrupt war criminals.</p>
<p>Keep in mind Trump’s 2020 campaign out performed Biden <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/donald-trump-made-gains-in-every-demographic-except-for-white-men/ar-BB1aJ1Rs">in every single demographic</a> aside from white males, that means a majority of Blacks, Asians, Hispanics, other races, and even white women, all voted in greater numbers for Trump than they did for Biden which is mindblowing even for myself. Furthermore, Republicans did not loose a single house race across the country, did not loose any house seats, and gained at least 7 seats. The republicans in the senate held their majority, and now holds <a href="https://i.imgur.com/nDO0rbw.jpeg">every single state legislature</a> where they will now be able to redraw county lines (Jerrymandering) for political advantage in at least 35 states. There was clearly no “Blue Wave,” and something is fundamentally wrong not only with Democrats approach to the Presidency, but with their approach to politics, their base, and nonvoters. I wonder if they will learn any of the necessary lessons after this time around.</p>
<p>It is for partly these reasons that Joe Biden nearly lost, and partly due to the fact that Biden is an objectively terrible candidate. He who vowed early on that “<a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/6/21/1866289/-Biden-assures-wealthy-donors-he-s-their-friend-Nothing-will-fundamentally-change">Nothing will fundamentally change</a>,” when speaking to Wallstreet, who will hire a cop as his vice president amid nationwide protests against police, and vow to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/510763-biden-says-he-supports-additional-funding-for-the-police">give police more money</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQSFrW2sJM0">refuses to ban fracking</a> (which I agree with for other reasons), and vowed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbq90xnV-o8&amp;t=1m38s">vito medicare for all</a> if it ever came across his desk. He was also famously for the Iraq war, and proud of his 1994 crime bill which made America the leader in imprisonment which of course affects people of color most because they are predominantly the ones in poverty even decades after explicitly racist policies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">Redlining</a>.</p>
<p>So while Trump has<a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/23/trump-expands-ban-on-critical-race-theory-to-federal-contractors/">banned Critical Race Theory</a> in governmental trainings, it instantly made the topic so toxic that no democrats will ever touch it, meaning that Joe Biden will continue to pander rhetorically to the far left while ignoring both them and the progressive left, resulting in a silent but potentially far reaching continuance of Critical Race Theory slowly eroding each pillar of our society to the extent that it has already, and more. This will eventually result in furthering the postmodernist woke agenda of both intersectional politics and actual Marxism in the quiet, yet insidious way as we have seen until we reach another boiling point far beyond what we have seen, today, at a time where it may be too late to structurally support the foundational pillars of America.</p>
<p>Biden’s <a href="https://joebiden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UNITY-TASK-FORCE-RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf">proposed federal credit financing plan</a> which came out of the Sanders/AOC task force is fundamentally hoping to due away with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy">meritocracy</a> that is the United States in order to impose a system that is ‘promoting racial equity.’ They will be “improving economic mobility for people of color,” and “addressing the racial wealth gap…In addition to expanding access to credit, working to boost homeownership and build more affordable housing, and supporting minority-owned small businesses,” in addition to “provid[ing] seed capital in order to access the economic security of asset ownership.” which is seemingly excluding all races outside of blacks and Native Americans, which would be violation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964">1964 Civil Rights act</a>, but would presumably be allowed if CA had passed prop 16, because, “Democrats believe we must embed environmental justice and climate justice at the heart of our policy and governing agenda…Democrats are committed to a comprehensive agenda to achieve racial equity.” And remember, <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-equity/">(equity) means equality of outcome, not equality of opportunity</a>, and a very loud portion of the left wants to gain power in order to script these authoritarian rules. I would say it’s not far off from <a href="https://gizmodo.com/chinese-citizens-with-bad-social-credit-to-be-blocked-f-1823845648#_ga=2.182409383.1230729801.1542224403-710048129.1536672815">China’s citizen ranking system</a>. This is important, and this was written by people who do not mince their words. The wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p>
<p>Despite all this, (or because of it) Joe Biden still almost lost. He could have easily endorsed, or even pretended to endorse some of the most popular 80/20 positions across the isle, and the nation including; decriminalization of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/5/18/21260228/joe-biden-marijuana-legalization-donald-trump-president">marijuana</a>, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/87-democrats-support-medicare-all-though-joe-biden-doesnt-1522833">medicare for all</a>, a progressive tax rate, another round of stimulus, wage replacement for keeping employees on payroll during the pandemic like many western nations, or any number of truly progressive or populist policies which would all disproportionately benefit the poorest Americans who are predominantly black and brown. Biden and the DNC strategically chose not to adopt these policies while simultaneously betraying every single anti establishment candidate in the Democratic primaries, especially front-runner Bernie Sanders. So when people inquire as to why Donald Trump is popular at all, or was a just a few thousand contested votes from winning reelection, just know it is not because of his racist supporters.</p>
<p>This phenomenon I’m discussing so seriously here, which can seem minor at times, is important to highlight because popular movements like: Vote blue no matter who, Black Lives Matter, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/30/feminists-anti-trans-idea-sex-gender-oppression">Feminism</a>, <a href="https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/smart-growth-policies-hurt-poor-and-minorities-report-alleges">The Environmental Movement</a>, etc. and the policies they most often aim to implement are disproportionately hurting the very people they claim to help. They are causing <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2019/04/29/five-practical-problems-for-the-green-new-deal/?sh=532e99163e8a">economic harm</a> which the United Nations <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">states</a> is the greatest factor in preventing development of the poorest in both America, and the third world who are consistently comprised of people of color, which improvements in economic prosperity for the worlds poor would otherwise be the fastest way to solve our global problems in a fair and balanced way.</p>
<p>Toppling the western governments of the world in favor of Marxism would cause a descent into chaos and ruthless game theoretic zero sum national coordination for resources, hoarding, and further strain on environmental resources including <a href="https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/where-the-water-wars-will-be-fought">control of water</a>. So no matter our path, it must involve thought out, meaningful, yet swift enough reform and mandates for clearly beneficial goals. Goals like a global carbon tax between $2 and $20 per metric ton with fees waived for developing nations. Goals like universal investments of between 0.2% and 2% of GDP to go towards R&amp;D into any form of green technology so that we may get solar panels to higher efficiencies near 40% needed to actually outpace fossil fuels in the short run, even though, along with wind, they will never be ‘sustainable’ though we will likely get closest with low scale geothermal or thorium. We could use this money to invent things needed in the meantime, like solid state or liquid air batteries and carbon capture which doesn’t yet exist in any meaningful way, even while all IPCC climate scenarios <a href="https://www.seeker.com/climate/ipcc-report-co2-capture-is-necessary-to-avoid-perilous-climate-change">rely on their use</a>. We must prioritize the best investments possible in a way that does not destabilize our international cooperative benefits, or cause any global wars both known to be much worse for all involved, harm the environment, and setback our continuing positive development trends.</p>
<p>It is so very important to point out, as always, that for the last 200 years, the world has been getting better, and reducing harm in <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/a-history-of-global-living-conditions-in-5-charts">almost every single way</a>, and this gives me hope for the future. This is consistent good news that somehow remains imperceptable in the mainstream media for obvious reasons, which leads to only 6% of Americans thinking that the world is getting better making 94% of Americans misinformed in a cynical way. Everything we are working on today should aim to continue <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty">these hugely positive trends</a> and prevent anything from going too far awry.</p>
<p>These edge cases of oppression are only heightened by growth hacking of social media and internet algorithms because attention, user data, and return on investment are the end goal. This is apparently desired from the left to be carried out by the same corporations who censor stories like the NY Post’s Hunter Biden Email drop, but to continue to allow stories of the same veracity like the “<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/07/22/revealed-christopher-steeles-own-source-debunked-pee-tape-claim-in-fbi-interview/">Pee Tape</a>,” or “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200709021015/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/russia-afghanistan-bounties.html">Putin paying out bounties for American soldiers</a>,” which always contain unsubstantiated, impossible to prove, off the record, anonymous “officials/sources” who’s statements are always qualified with “if true,” because these ones ‘help our guy,’ and hurt ‘their guy.’ The average people outside of our own in-groups, ‘They’ are not evil. Furthermore if your personal ‘They’ is all Republicans, remember that they beat Democrats in every state legislature up for reelection, gained a seat in the house, secured their lead in the senate, and are set up for an even bigger win in 2022, while the Democrats saw no such thing as the highly anticipated Blue wave, not even close, and we need to ask ourselves why. We need to consider if voter shaming for Joe Biden had anything to with his winning, and if these average disaffected voters forced to turn out actually voted for Biden while leaving every house and senate seat blank, because they’re all the same. Who knows, and at this point we all watch different TV channels and get our news from a million sources so it’s impossible to stay on the same page and make sense of the world. Furthermore, the media is teaching us to hate each other, I’m willing to bet none of us could justify some of the things I’ve seen on twitter this past four years without the comforting rhetoric of the media.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that Trump has lost in 2020 (though barely) for some amount of good reason. Joe Biden will actually improve some tangible aspects of society and generally simmer things down which is certainly worth noting. Biden will re-enter the non-binding Paris Accord, he will likely draw up a new Iran Deal, and reinstate Trump’s cuts to Medicaid &amp; Food Stamps, in addition to the most important in my opinion being that America once again has an amicable and professional politician leading the U.S. in global discourse. On the other hand, once the anti establishment candidates: Sanders, Tulsi, and Yang lost the primaries, and Biden picked Harris as his running mate, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kamala-harris-has-taken-on-wall-street-wall-street-doesnt-seem-to-mind-11597254609">“Wallstreet sighs in relief.”</a> As the establishment wins, Wallstreet wins, The Intellegence Community wins, Big Banks win, Raytheon wins, Pfizer wins while the American people loose, but this should not be a game.</p>
<p>If we want a return to sensemaking, if we want a world that is rooted in justifiable collective action to address real inequalities that exist based on current or historical barriers, corruption, or corporate capture, we need to bolster our four foundational mechanisms of Politics, Media, Academia, and Institutions so that we can vote for something other than the lesser of two evils, so that we can trust the paper of record, so that we can be assured that the peer review process is non-biased, and so that we believe the CDC when they make claims about the effectiveness of mask wearing.</p>
<p>This should be our goal, this should always be our goal so that we can move on, past these foundational things, to the real work of doing good in America, and in the world, prioritizing which problems to solve first and making sure we do the most good for the greatest number of people for the least amount of money; That is, at least until we have a global society that is not bound to game theoretic incentives fundamentally opposed to a sustainable world in the long run. We need to have real, global, data driven conversations about how to make this transition, we do not need to overthrow the American Government. We need enough stability for cooperation which a Trump presidency can never provide, and we need our own internal sensemaking sorted out so that as America, we can continue to be among the global leaders in best practices, and invite all countries and The United Nations to participate in honest debate at how to proceed in making the world a better place.</p>
