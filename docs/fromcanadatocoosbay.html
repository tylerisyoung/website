<h3>
How pipeline politics, climate change, and oil spills, can create
incentives that muddy the waters.
</h3>
<center>
<img src="Journalism/Environment/fromcanadatocoosbay/pipeline01.jpg" />
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the parking lot of the Veterans’ Affairs building, clusters of
glowing faces watch a projected broadcast of the public hearing
happening within. Pacing side to side and warming their hands with their
breath, onlookers intermittently weigh in on the testimonies in hushed
voices.</p>
<p>An eager line of people extends out from the building and mixes with
the crowd outside. They are all waiting for the chance to either condemn
or support the removal-fill permit proposal of the Jordan Cove Pipeline,
a project belonging to the Canadian energy corporation, Pembina, which
seeks to construct a 229 mile liquid natural gas pipeline (LNG) from
Malin, to Coos Bay, Oregon. Having been twice denied by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for failing to provide evidence for
public benefit, the pipeline is now under the consideration of the
Department of State Lands for the third time.</p>
<p>Leading the charge against the pipeline are environmentalist
organizations such as Our Children’s Trust (OCT), Rogue Climate,
Cascadia Wildlands and 350 Eugene, a local chapter of 350.org.</p>
Allie Rosenbluth, campaign director for Rogue Climate, says that in the
wake of the hearings she and her team are taking a much needed rest
while continuing to push for additional public comments through online
outreach. “Communities have stopped it before,” Rosenbluth says, “we’ll
continue to be the watch dogs.”
<center>
<img src="Journalism/Environment/fromcanadatocoosbay/pipeline02.jpg" />
</center>
<p>Among those submitting comments at the hearings are plaintiffs from
the historic Youth v. Gov. case in which youths between the ages of 11
and 22 have filed suit against the government for violating their rights
by contributing to climate change. The case was first filed in 2015 and
is lead by Eugene’s own Kelsey Juliana. Also part of the lawsuit is
climate scientist James Hansen, the former director of NASA’s Goddard
Institute for Space Studies. Hansen’s famous saying, “the only safe
level of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere is below
350 Parts per million,” he inspired the name for the environmental
organization 350.org.</p>
<p>The parties are suing several branches of the U.S. government,
including the Departments of Energy, Commerce, and the Interior, for
allowing excessive carbon emissions to be released into the atmosphere.
Commonly known as the “Trial of the Century,” more pretrial briefs are
due to be filed in February and March, 2019.</p>
<p>The effects of the Jordan Cove Pipeline would contrast with the
ambitions put forth by the OCT plaintiffs, as the project would be
Oregon’s largest investment in greenhouse gas infrastructure to date.
Pembina claims that the construction would employ 6,000 people, and once
completed, retain more than 200 workers to operate the terminal. Though
other organizations like Citizens Against LNG and Counter Punch claim
there would be only 100 permanent jobs, and most of them would not be
filled by Oregon citizens. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has
also previously cited this concern.</p>
Despite this discrepancy, Pembina asserts that their pipeline would
bring 10 billion dollars to the state and local economies. Many of the
impacted communities, formerly beneficiaries of local investments from
the timber industry, have been patiently waiting for such a project.
<center>
<img src="Journalism/Environment/fromcanadatocoosbay/pipeline03.jpg" />
</center>
<p>Oregon’s elected officials and politicians who are consistently
called upon to make public statements either for or against the project
are caught between these two groups. There is no apparent middle ground
solution on the horizon.</p>
<p>Scott Strickland, union organizer for Local 701 of the International
Union of Operating Engineers, represents the interests of the 3,500
workers who build much of Oregon’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>“You know I think of myself as environmentally minded too,” he says.
“We don’t want there to be leaks or pollution in our water either, but
it’s a question of ‘is it going to be here or there?’”</p>
<p>While Strickland admits that there are alway risks that come with
building a pipeline, he wonders if Oregon, with its various
environmental protection laws, would be a safer place to have the LNG
line than in a state without those protections.</p>
<p>According to Oregon.gov, Oregon’s Removal-Fill Law (ORS 196.795-990)
“requires people who plan to remove or fill material in wetlands or
waterways to obtain a permit from the Department of State Lands (DSL).”
This requirement is the reason for the various public comment hearings
that occurred throughout the state and ended in the capital on Jan. 15,
2019.</p>
<p>The Jordan Cove Pipeline would go through more than 400 waterways,
streams, lakes, rivers, and wetlands, like a scar across the landscape
of Southern Oregon. Leaks are not only possible, but over time,
practically inevitable. In 2014, there was a major LNG leak in Plymouth,
WA, along the Columbia river causing hundreds of people to evacuate.
Officials claimed if rare conditions of oxygen mixture were met, and an
ignition source were present, an explosion spanning three quarters of a
mile could have ensued. However, it is important to note that according
to Breaking Energy, contrary to popular belief, a “spill” of the liquid
natural gas which the pipeline would be carrying will usually result in
a quick boiling and evaporation of the gas into the atmosphere. That
said, it would do very minor damage to the environment apart from the
long term greenhouse gas emission effects.</p>
In other words, any leaks or spills from the Jordan Cove Pipeline, aside
from something catastrophic, would evaporate quickly, and leave almost
no trace on the immediate environment.
<center>
<img src="Journalism/Environment/fromcanadatocoosbay/pipeline04.jpg" />
</center>
<p>The United States is the world’s largest producer of natural gas,
currently supplying about one-third of all U.S. energy needs, and
one-half of its household heating fuel. Natural gas, which is extracted
from fracking, is roughly 600 times more dense in its liquid form than
in its gaseous form. Cooling the gas down to a temperature of -260
degrees Fahrenheit allows it to be transported in specialized tanker
ships to locations unreachable by pipelines. The Jordan Cove Connector
Pipeline would cut the travel time of transporting the gas from the
interior of the U.S. to the coastline, becoming a more efficient and
profitable means of transport for Pembina.</p>
<p>The Pipeline, if approved, would transport natural gas through a
double-layered pipe made of reinforced stainless steel. The pipes are
mostly placed underground and are often invisible from the surface after
installment. On their website, Pembina has uploaded a beautiful photo of
plush green farmland being replanted over a pipeline to indicate there
would be minimal impact to the current landscape. In Oregon, however,
where winters can be harsh, and rain is a given, underground pipes
within a few feet of topsoil can easily disrupt the landscape. Moreover,
even slight shifts in the pipeline, over time, can cause leaks.</p>
<p>Oil Change International (OCI), a nonprofit organization that seeks
to expose the true costs of fossil fuels, conducted a thorough
investigation on the Jordan Cove Pipeline. They reported it would emit
36 million metric tons of CO2, 15.4 times as much as Oregon’s last
remaining coal fired power plant. According to BP Oil’s 2017 data, of
the United State’s 5,087.7 million metric tons of annual CO2 emissions
the pipeline would account for 0.71% of the United States carbon
footprint. OCI calls for a reduction of fossil fuel emissions to zero by
mid century.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions are the largest contributor to climate change,
accounting for 65% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Methane (CH4) is
another greenhouse gas which is burned to power many of our household
appliances, like stoves and water heaters. Methane itself is responsible
for 16% of greenhouse gasses emitted, though when it is burned a
chemical reaction takes place, which turns the methane into CO2 and
gives off heat as a by product. The oil development fields around the
country which are drilling, cracking, and fracking the earth for natural
gas, are typically harvesting the CH4 which is piped to our
stovetops.</p>
<p>The Jordan Cove pipeline is a connector pipeline, which would connect
existing LNG infrastructure throughout the United States with Oregon,
where it would be placed on tanker ships and exported to Asian markets.
It would be the first LNG export terminal on the west coast of the
continental United States. As of now, the existing LNG infrastructure
across the nation is either being used for domestic consumption or being
shipped to foreign markets through export terminals in Texas and the
Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>It’s a long way to the Asian markets, and though LNG has a far better
safety record than traditional crude oil, as documented by the U.S.
Department of Transportation, there is an undeniable history of leaks
and explosions which can happen in any number of ways, from the mining,
to the storage, or in transport. A study conducted by Scientific
American demonstrates that gas leaks are difficult to trace. Some
natural gas companies already in operation can give us a better
understanding of what leakage rates might be.</p>
<p>The largest gas distribution company in the United States, Southern
California Gas Co., states that their loss rate was 0.84% in 2011 and
0.87% in 2012. This is quite low when compared to Washington Gas Light
Co., serving the Washington DC area, whose loss rates were 4.04% in 2011
and 3.65% in 2012. Some natural gas extraction sites in Russia, a large
producer of global LNG, have loss rates as high as 7.0%. The gas
companies themselves are careful to state that the gas is simply
“unaccounted for,” which could mean a leak, an accounting error, or
inconsistent conversion rates, among other explanations for the
discrepancy.</p>
<p>Leakage rates above 3% could offset any benefits of a cleaner fossil
fuel, reported that in Washington, D.C., the gas transport system had
more than 6,000 leaks across 1,500 miles of pipeline — four leaks per
mile. While that number includes pipes attached to households (which can
be very old), any leak is potentially dangerous. They also found that in
12 locations, methane had accumulated to “explosive levels” (defined as
between 50,000 and 500,000 PPM). A similar study conducted in Boston
found almost 3,400 leaks over 785 miles of pipeline, averaging 4.3 leaks
per mile.</p>
<p>While the 229 mile long Jordan Cove Pipeline is much shorter than
pipelines elsewhere, and would not be connecting to households directly,
the gas would eventually be piped through to local infrastructure, and
into households or industrial machinery. Using the D.C. and Boston
studies as reference, unless newer techniques emerge, there is a
possibility of up to 936 to 1,010 leaks in total. An average of 4.15
leaks per mile.</p>
<p>Currently, the law does not require Pembina to consider the
pipeline’s climatological effects, nor adhere to the concerns of Native
tribal members, who have come out in opposition to the pipeline. Tribal
Councils all over the state of Oregon have stated that Pembina gives no
consideration to their upstream water rights and traditional burial
grounds, which the pipeline could disrupt. They will however need to
contend with required wetland restoration in correlation to the amount
of construction they are doing on wetland ecosystems.</p>
Don Gentry, Chairman of the Klamath Tribal Council, expressed his
people’s worries about the pipeline numerous times over the years. “We
are concerned about the economy, but we are also concerned with
sustainability,” he said. “We lived off the land. We aren’t
conservationists.”
<center>
<img src="Journalism/Environment/fromcanadatocoosbay/pipeline05.jpg" />
</center>
<p>Aside from the risks to fish and wildlife, which are important for
spiritual ceremonies, and are part of the traditional diet of the
Klamath people, Gentry says that the major excavation of lands for the
pipeline will indefinitely unearth ancient burial grounds. “Once that
damage is done, it’s done,” he said speaking from experience. A 1993
article published by Herald and News, Klamath Falls’ local paper, reads
as follows:</p>
<p>“State highway engineers are redesigning a bridge under construction
across the Klamath River south of Klamath Falls after crews uncovered
remains of what are believed to be Native Americans of ancient
origin.Work on the Highway 97 bridge was halted May 10 after workers
discovered human bones strewn about in dirt that had been moved by heavy
equipment.”</p>
Gentry attested to being present at the reburial of these ancestral
remains, saying the experience was painful and traumatic. “It makes us
feel like we aren’t as important as other people when our remains are
disturbed,” he said concluding, “enough is enough.”

<img src="Journalism/Environment/fromcanadatocoosbay/pipeline06.jpg" />
<center>
<p>In an article originally published by Street Roots called, “Jordan
Cove LNG pipeline ‘a never-ending nightmare,’” the author reports that
any wetland mitigation that does not take place at the source of
construction is hardly mitigating the effects at all. Restoration
efforts elsewhere, which aim to offset the overall impact, would do
little to help the local communities and wildlife that will actually be
affected by the construction. Nonetheless, the efforts qualify as
permitted mitigation. This scenario would be like the Flint, Michigan,
municipality paying for watershed and wetland mitigation in Louisiana
while their own river, and source of drinking water, continues to remain
as polluted as it is today. The overall wetland acreage in the world
remains the same, though people nearest to the project will continue to
suffer the consequences of the pipeline.</p>
This issue could present itself as the pipeline’s construction will need
to remove, and displace large amounts of land, throughout the proposed
route, and this could lead to disturbed soil, ecosystem damage, and the
contamination of groundwater.

</center>
<p>Many organizations, like 350.org, Greenpeace and the Sierra Club,
have been instrumental in educating the public on the concerns of
ecosystem function and climate change. More people than ever in the
industrialized world are now concerned about the potentially
catastrophic warming of two to eight degrees Celsius, which can result
in a number of negative environmental impacts.</p>
<p>The problem, as many environmentalists put it, is the difficulty of
curbing the greenhouse gas emissions of developing nations, especially
the larger ones. China, India and Sub Saharan Africa, all with massively
growing populations, are gearing up for large scale and rapid
industrialization. It’s not as simple as saying they must simply go
through the industrialization process using 100% clean energy, largely
due to the fact that it is still more expensive at this moment in time
to do so. Using clean energy would slow their development, keeping their
people in poverty longer, as widespread use of cheap energy is the
driving factor behind developing nations economic growth.</p>
<p>Under the current economic system, it is often said that there is an
inherent subsidization of any industry using fossil fuels for production
and the externality of that cost will be paid by our children and our
grandchildren. That’s is why the plaintiffs are suing the government in
the Youth v. Gov case.The public trust doctrine states that “public
lands, waters and natural resources are to be held in trust for the
benefit of the public.” Currently, the federal government has no
comprehensive plan in place to protect these resources. The Juliana
plaintiffs claim that if we want our planet to remain under 2 degrees
Celsius, it is going to be a battle.</p>
<p>Naomi Klein, a Canadian author and social activist, who has visited
and spoke at the University of Oregon in the past, advocates for a
carbon tax and divestment from the fossil fuel industry in her book
“This Changes Everything, Capitalism vs. The Climate.” She writes that
once large scale investments have been decided on, it is difficult to
change course, and that as time goes on, more drastic mitigation efforts
will be required. She also claims there is no shortage of options to
equitably fund the lowering of carbon emissions. Among other things,
Klein suggests a $50 tax per metric ton of CO2 emitted in developed
countries, and the phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies. The revenue
from this and additional measures, if implemented simultaneously, would
amount to roughly $2 trillion annually, which she claims is the seed
money for “a very healthy start to finance a Great Transition (and avoid
a Great Depression).”</p>
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s latest report on
climate change states, “Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would require
rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of
society…limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C could go hand
in hand with ensuring a more sustainable and equitable society.”
<center>
<img src="Journalism/Environment/fromcanadatocoosbay/pipeline08.jpg" />
</center>
<p>Many politicians refer to the IPCC as an authority figure on climate
data. Leaders are now looking to the panel for information as they make
political decisions on these matters. The IPCC typically releases a
climate report every six years and has recently released an important
special report in 2018. In this most recent report, the IPCC has
reiterated its intention to influence nations to make drastic and far
reaching changes to infrastructure.</p>
<p>The IPCC continues in the vein of Naomi Klein and the major
environmental organizations, advising that if we do not act quickly and
radically, unalterable damage to the climate will ensue. Still, it might
be worth exploring alternative narratives like that of Bjorn Lomborg who
has written on global welfare, and given an analysis of economics in
climate change throughout his books, “How to spend $75 Billion to Make
the World a Better Place,” “Cool It,” and “Prioritizing
development.”</p>
<p>Lomborg first indicates that the IPCC’s warming prediction has
actually gone down in their recent reports when compared to 1990 data.
He also notes that climate models have very wide margins of error, and
that organizations like Greenpeace, 350.org, and the Sierra Club often
lead with the highest estimates as they are interest groups who have
members, subscribers, and lobbyists who all benefit when the climate
predictions and stories told continue to get worse. This places them at
the forefront of the climate movement, and on the front page of the news
where “if it bleeds it leads.” As polar bears tend to do.</p>
<p>University of Sussex economist Richard Tol claims that a carbon tax
is a terribly inefficient means of mitigating climate change. He says
that drastic carbon cuts will do more harm than good, and that the
effects of an 80% reduction in carbon emissions to achieve the 2 degrees
celsius of warming mark by 2100 will be felt by developing nations
most.</p>
<p>Ambient air pollution killed nearly 6 million people globally in
2010, more than alcohol and drugs combined, and many of these deaths
were in developing nations and Southern Asia. These same markets, who
cannot afford green energy, could cheaply reduce dangerous levels of
ambient, and household 2.5 micron particulate matter air pollution by
substituting the higher carbon footprint fuel used for cooking and
heating; biomass and replacing it with natural gas.</p>
<p>Lomborg suggests we count all humans, in all areas, as equal,
prioritize human welfare, and bring as many people out of poverty, as
fast as possible, as he claims this has been demonstrated to do the most
overall good, both in maintaining equity between nations, and in
reinforcing the climate’s relatively stable position.</p>
<p>The issue of climate economics is complicated, and with no one group
having all the answers, the void left by uncertainty can leave room for
convincing… Pembina has offered a lot of financial help to Oregon
communities in need. They helped the Egyptian Theater in Coos Bay
purchase new curtain rigging equipment, helped fund Dillian’s Park, an
all inclusive park in North Bend, purchased paint for the Winchester Bay
Lighthouse, and commissioned several other community investments. But
all this generosity makes you wonder if Pembina is attempting to buy
popularity.</p>
<p>In addition to these donations, Pembina has also recently offered
landowners in the path of the pipeline $30,000 as a pre-approved payment
with a deadline to accept their offer by December 31, 2018. If the
project does not go through, the homeowners would be able to keep this
payment. This is in addition to any offers they have already made, and
is likely a means of persuading FERC into approving their permits. When
Pembina was previously denied, the board cited the fact that the company
only had homeowner approval for a small portion of the proposed
route.</p>
<p>On one hand, there’s an energy company with a lot of money, and on
the other, there are activists with endless willpower who are gathering
data to bring to the courts. Nonetheless, transparency and education are
needed at every level. Rather than emotion and dollar signs influencing
negotiations, knowledge and reason should be guiding inclusive and
democratic decisions. Environmental solutions are not always black and
white, but the fact remains that there are two paths forward. Either
Pembina will be permitted to build a pipeline that will bring jobs to
local economies and provide economic benefit along with pollution to the
atmosphere, or the permits will be blocked by either Oregon’s officials
or the Federal Energy Regulatory commission in favor of preserving the
climate. Which side are you on?</p>
