<h3>
Democratic governors can do no wrong in the era of orange man bad.
</h3>
<p><br> CUOMO WILL NOT CRACK! New York State has the most confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the United States, and will soon have the most in the world outside of China. Governor Andrew Cuomo is quickly becoming the local hero as mainstream media appreciates his vocal concern for residents, and his general distaste for president Trump. The LA Times published a headline reading “Cuomo is a Coronavirus Star, but Newsom is Quietly Bending the Curve.” Which is true, but what that article does not mention is that a month from now, Cuomo may be the star for all the wrong reasons, and if he weren’t a politician, he might even face time in prison.</p>
<div id="bias-in-reporting" class="section level2">
<h2>Bias in Reporting</h2>
<p>An article from a left leaning website JACOBIN, who’s owner is literally a socialist discovers a scandal which will never be discussed by mainstream media, leaning further and further into Andrew Cuomo’s theatrical display of concern for the people of his state. So take this with a grain of red salt, but I’ll take their reporting any day to The NY Times and their never ending manufacturing of consent. Despite Jacobin and their ideas for America, the evidence, both physical and circumstantial is as follows:</p>
<p>President Trump has been holding daily press briefings which discuss the current events of the pandemic and lockdown in America, every day I watch as the media on left and right take something and run away with it - far away. It is amazing how detached from reality today’s reporting is, and how little actual news is being reported compared to the slough of opinion, but I will bee that to a minimum for the time being. In the March 29 press conference, there was some telling info about how many ventilators, masks, and other PPE equipment was in the national stockpile and what was being done to create more, the following exchange includes timestamps from yahoo finance livestream of the pandemic briefing. President Trump in his adress to the nation mentions that there are still 10,000 ventilators in the national stockpile, and thousands have been sent out, many to NY. Reporters are able to ask questions after the briefings and today Trump is asked about Florida receiving a full supply of ventilators &amp; PPE they requested, while Cuomo and some other democratic governors demand more, the reporter presuming this bias based on what Trump had said in an interview with Sean Hannity on March 26.</p>
<p>At this point, I decided to bite the bullet and watch my first Sean Hannity interview on Fox News from March 26th. I equate this to a Rachel Madow show on CNN talking about anything Russia - which she knowingly lied about for years, was sued over doing so, and now has to classify her show as opinion with her own lawyers arguing in court nothing she says on air should be taken as fact. 1 My overall opinion of the 40 minute interview between Trump &amp; Hannity is that while they did some unjust hating on democrats, they also made some valid criticisms of the left, and actually delivered a lot of facts and insight as to what was being done about the current pandemic. They are after all equally opinionated &amp; fact based as CNN, or NBC. These left leaning fact or opinion shows and news on CNN are to Conservatives what Fox News is to Democrats. Hannity did press about concrete numbers, but like in the daily press briefings, Trump only talked about minimizing everything without giving any real numbers. The Weeds In reference to governors, trump says; “ 16:00 (mostly verbatim) “ but remember, we’re really a second live of attack, the first line is supposed to be the hospitals, and the local government, the states themselves, we have people like governor Insley, he should be doing more he shouldn’t be relying on the federal government, Ainsley, he was a failed presidential candidate and he is always complaining and your governor of michigan, I mean she’s not stepping up, I don’t know if she knows what’s going on, but all she does it sit there and blame the federal government, she doesn’t get it done, and we send her a lot, not she wants a declaration of emergency and you know we’ll have to make a decision on that but you know michigan is a very important state I loge the people of michigan, you know I am bringing many car factories back to michigan, you know she is a new governor, and it’s not been pleasant, and you look around and see what’s going on, and by the way, most governors have been fantastic , I have to tell you most of them whether it’s democrat or its republican, but we really have some trouble with the state of Washington, you know the governor, he ran for president he didn’t exactly do well, he got zero and we’ve had a big problem with the young a woman governor you know who I’m talking about from michigan, so we can’t you you know we uh we don’t like to see the complaints and I am getting along with governor Cuomo, I think a lot of things are being said that are more, I don’t thing that certain things will materialize, and you know a lot of equipment is being asked for which I don’t think they’ll need but I’m building, you know we’re building four hospitals four medical centers and we’ve developed many other things and sent thousands of ventilators and hopefully they’re going to do well, but you know you have to understand, this has to be managed by local government and the governors, it can’t be managed by the federal government, with that being said, we inherited a largely empty you would call it a chain, think of monster warehouses across the country again a broken chain, and we’re filling it up very strongly and we’re delivering the equipment most of the times we have it go directly to the states so we’re really helping all the governors, we had a call today with just about all of them and it was like a love fest! They’re all so happy, now in the case of NY and the case of Louisiana where you have a very good governor, John bell Edwards, but he’s a democrat, and he’s very thankful for what we’re doing we’re building a hospital for him, these are sort of potrable hospitals but they’re incredible when you see them go up and they’re built by fema and the army core of engineers, they’re incredible people they can’t get enough credit for the job they’re doing." Hannity responds talking about the bill &amp; criticizing Cuomo and trump responds to a few points then trump goes on to say “ 2 (The bill) “and it’s a wonderful thing, the problem we have is that it’s very very painful dealing with the democrats because they ask for things they have been trying to get for 10 years, that we don’t want to get, but if we get the 2 trillion dollars that gets sent out to people to workers, we don’t get the two trillion dollars that’s going to really save companies, we have a lot of this money is going to save Boeing, the airline industry, and it means tremendous jobs ….. etc…..companies are great etc… you know it’s a very difficult thing with the democrats so we end up giving them something for Kennedy center, because you know Kennedy center got hit hard,… but we give things that we not want to give you know what I’m talking about you have them up on your screen, but you have to in order to get, we cut out, and you said it better than anybody, we cut out most of it, if you would have seen some of the things we were giving up and it’s a shame that we can’t just sit down and easily its always just such a big deal I mean it went on and on and on late into the night every night, and this could have been done in one day, the bottom line is that we got a 96 to nothing vote and I think all of the senators that weren’t there, they were in quarantine, and the case of rand Paul, a good guy by the way he actually has this problem, and he will be alright I talked to him today … .. etc… etc… New york is a bigger deal, but it’s gonna go also , I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said are just bigger than they’re gong to be I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators, I mean you go into some major hopitalals sometimes and you know they have only 2 ventilators and now all of a sudden they’re saying can we order 30,000 ventilators so look it’s a very bad situation we haven’t seen anything like it but the end result is we gotta get back to work andI think that we can start by opening up certain parts of the country, you know the farm belt, certain parts of the Midwest, you know other places , but uh I think that as as an example, you go to Texas there are places in Texas great govenor Greg abbot there are places in Texas you know it’s a tremendously big state which aren’t impacted by this, so I think we can op[en up sections quadrants and keep them going until the whole country is opened up, bu we have to open up, the people want to get back to work they want to get back, that’s the way we’re engineered. Later on in the interview not related to governors, they mentioned something I have not yet seen from CNN, Hannity says; Mr president, tonight you’re having a call with president Xi of China, “we know this now as a fact, it’s indisputable, they hid it, they lied about it, uh mike Pompeii said china is still not being forthcoming, and he went further and said Russia is not being forthcoming, and we know Iran that they - we know the conspiracy theory in china which they have been pushing against the United States, you said you get along with president xi, you have this trade deal 220 billion in two years, what do you say about him withholding information and moving forward why did they lie to us? Trump responds “Well let’s go back, you mentioned Russia, rissia looks like they’re having quite a bit of a problem, and people weren’t bringing it up that whole thing with the virus, and we know Iran we know that’s been really really bad, we have offered them assistance, we have have the greatest people in the rolls the greatest people at thing ting in the world, and with china, they said that some of our soldiers caused the problem, and we’re saying what soldiers , what are you talking about, and it wasn’t by him I don’t believe and it got out there, I started calling it the Chinese virus and everyone picked it up, I’m not looking to do that look its better to have a good relationship I mean we have a good trade deal after many many years, and it should have been done by Obama and by the way previous administrations, and nobody and no body has ripped this country like china, we were loosing 4-5 billion dollars every year to china and this went back many many years so we now have a great peace of the trade deal and now we will start phase two and we’re taking in billions of dollars a year in tariffs and they’re paying for it because they devalued their currency and other things, so lets get along with china, lets get along with Russia, we’;l seeif we can do something with Iran , wI mean I think they want to make a deal if they don’t if they got a problem but uh we’ll see what happens, and when president Obama made that deal it was one of the worst deals that I have ever seen. 3 Trumps concludes the interview by saying I get along great with Fauchi, I get along with Deborah, look we’re all in this together this is not a question of that, and I get along with most of the governors, I don’t like it though when some governors I mean you know I mentioned tow of them but some of these governors they take take talk then they complain they take and you god a great job you build them a hospital and they’re always complaining so I don’t like that but generally speaking we get along, I’m actually getting along very well with governor Cuomo we’re you know we’re actually sending a ship there it was supposed to leave four weeks ago, but now it’s going Saturday . . . Hannity compliments the First Lady and they sign off. “ So those are the comments in question that the reporter in the press conference is referring to when she tasks her question: The reporter asks her question again at 1:16:00 Which immediately turns into a partisan yelling match in which Trump calls out the reporter for formerly working at New York Times and is now working elsewhere. She gets to ask her question and Here was the exchange: Reporter: “I have two questions, the first is you’ve said repeatedly that some of there equipment some of the governors are requesting they don’t actually need, you said New York might not actually need 30,000 - Trump: I didn’t say that - Reporter: “You said it on Sean Hannity’s Fox News, you said - “ Trump: Come on, You know why don’t why don’t you people act why don’t you act in a little more positive it’s always trying to get you get you get you and you know what, that’s why nobody trusts the media anymore Reporter: my question is how is that going to impact - Trump: Excuse me, you didn’t hear me, That’s why you used to work for the times and now you work for somebody else, look let me tell you something… be nice…. Don’t be threatening…. Be nice, go ahead Reporter: My question is. how is that going to impact how you fill these orders for ventilators or masks your views that - Trump: Its not gonna impact, we’re producing a tremendous amount of ventilators we’re doing a great job on it, Mike pence out Vice President is headed up the task force which has been incredible the job they’ve done, we have everybody in the whitehouse working on it everyone in the country is working on it in one way or another, the fact is that we’ve done a great job of delivering, you’ve seen the biggest people in the business and there’s no body even close to this group of people we have a meeting at three ococlock it lasted ifor a long time it was a great meeting with the generals 4 with everybody else and they have done a fantastic job, I’m just staying this if they’re holding, let me give you one example, we sent thousands of generators to New York, they were put into a warehouse a New York warehouse that happened to be located interestingly in Edison NJ, they were given to NY and we then went to other places also giving thousands of ventilators, the people in NY never distributed the generators, we said why didn’t you distribute em? Now you have to understand, they have New York people working in those warehouses, they knew that had em so we said why didn’t you distribute them, I hope they have distributed them now, but maybe they didn’t need em so badly, but just so you know we’re all you, me everybody, we’re all on the same team, you know when journalists get up, and you’re a journalists get up and you’re a journalist, a fine journalist, when journalists get up and ask questions that are so threatening, we’re all on the same team - Reporter: I was quoting you directly from Sean Hannity Trump: Take a look at my interview, what I want to do, is if there is something wrong, we have to get to the bottom of it, when I hear facemarks go from 10,000 to 300,000 and they constantly need more, and the biggest man in the business is like shocked, he knows all about the virus by the way, he’s not surprised by that, he shouldn’t be surprised, he ghouls say we’ll that’s standard because this is realy a very tough disease, this is really a very tough virus to handle. Reporter: My second question is.. Trump to other reporter Trump: Yes please go ahead, please that’s enough if we have time we’ll get back to you thank you that’s enough. I believe the exact quote she was referring to is underlined above. A colleague of the reporter then hands her back the microphone, sacrificing his turn so that the same reporter may ask her second question. Picked up at 1:30:00 Reporter: Mr president, states like Florida have reportedly had 100% of their requests for supplies from the national strategic stockpile filled, but other states like Massachusetts have not, so how is that assessment being made, and why has Florida gotten their requests filled? Trump: Well I think that you’re gonna find that most, well almost all states, look I was on the call yesterday with the governors, and they were happy with the job we are doing, and I’ll tell you what if you had a different administration they would not have been happy, these are people that speak their mind, they were happy, uh it was falsely reported by a couple of people that oh gee they weren’t, they were happy, they were thrilled, Florida has been taken care of, and michigan has been taken care of, very important state, to me its very important because I’m, so proud of what we’ve done bringing car companies back into michigan and we’re now dealing with the govenor , and I think Mike [motions to 5 pence] I can say that a lot of good things are happening in michigan, Massachusetts we’re dealing with the governor very strongly and we’re trying to get things to Massachusetts as rapidly as possible. Reporter: Why has Florida received 100% of its requests compared to some other states is there a reason? Trump: Well Florida look they’re very aggressive in trying to get things, and they’re doing a very good job but I think I can say all of the governors are very committed, we’re very committed, we’re working together, and we’re getting things out at a level that no one has ever sene before, you can speak to fed ex, you can speak to UPS, they have never done anything like this what what’re doing now, and nobody in the world has been able to match what these great companies have been able to do, if we left that to government, it would her been a tough thing, we have mobilized private enterprise, we have mobilized the greatest companies in the world, and what is happening is incredible and that includes Abbot , who all of a sudden comes out of nowhere with this incredible test that simplifies everything and makes it so easy, so I think you’re going to find most states are very happy, i’m dealing with the governor of Louisiana, John bell Eduwards, He’s a democrat if that’s what you’re getting at, but I’m dealing with him very successfully, I think he is very happy, I think he’s actually amazed at what he’s bene able to get, In fact we’re even forward thinking, I suggested we send additional ventilators and other tings, we’re building a hospital in Louisiana very importantly, we’re building hospitals in New Jersey governor Murphy of New Jersey is a terrific guy and frankly he wants he’s got a pretty hot spot right here right next to New York and we’re doing hospitals and were doing ventilators, we’re getting a lot to governor Murphy that’s New Jersey, last night I spoke to the governor of Connecticut , we had a great talk with him, we are really doing a job, look Gavin newsome, the governor of California, we’s been terrific, we sent him a boat, a ship way ahead of schedule, the hospital ship, The Mercy with 1000 beds, operating rooms, and it’s been in LA for three days already , and I think they’re really happy and when you think about it, in NY, we’ve built 2900 hospital rooms, beds, nobody has ever seen it before, the governor has never seen anything like that before, this was done by federal government, not bey state governemrny, they opening it tumor,w I wanted to be there so badly but secret service and all of the people involved, won’t let me, they won’t let me for obviously reasons, but I would have loved to have been at the opening of the hospital tomorrow in New York at Javits Center, we’re very proud of the job we’ve done we’ve mobilized and getting better and better everyday, the task force headed by your Vice President, the job they’ve done, and they don’t even sleep. - End Transcription - There’s a lot going on here so I’m going to deconstruct some of it now. PPE Requests Florida got 100% of their requests filled and there’s no denying that. It is unfortunate that Trump has mentioned that “they are aggressive in trying to get things,” as this clouds what might be going on. It may be due to favoritism, but I don’t see that playing a role for two reasons; First, I am not so sure trump is making those sorts of decisions as to who gets what, he clearly references and motions to Pence and the task force which includes Fauchi as the decision makers during the briefing and insinuating he is not the one distributing anything. Secondly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is the one doing the actual distributing of goods. An article in Orlando weekly references an HHS press briefing which 6 “told states this week that it is giving out 25% of the stockpile to states according to population size, and sending another 25% strategically to states with the most severe outbreaks, which can be used for needs such as testing passengers on cruise ships brought back to shore. The remaining 50% will be held in “strategic reserve,” to be used if there’s a huge spike of critical needs around the country.” The article goes on to claim many are in fear that their case diagnosis rates may soon begin to soar as test capacity if expanded, and many are demanding supplies with the expectation of this, rather than the reality of the tests, but the numbers of requested items from a few states are as follows, “The system appears to roughly conform to states’ populations, rather than the size of their requests. Florida, a state of 21 million, got all 180,000 N95 masks it wanted. Oregon, a state of 4 million, only received 40,000 of the 400,000 masks it requested, and New Jersey, a state of 9 million, got 85,000 of the 2.9 million masks it feels it needs. It is hard to assess what constitutes a reasonable request. All states are starting with different stockpiles of supplies. Some have been hit harder than others by the virus, and some anticipate they might be. Each state is trying to secure as much as possible for its health workers, who are raising alarms that they are running out of basic supplies” There is not a lot of reporting on request numbers, but from this example of Florida vs. Oregon, it is clear that at least some states are requesting different amounts which are not tied to population size or confirmed infections. Oregon has literally requested twice the amount as Florida has without the numbers to justify this, requests are not data. Leading to some orders to be entirely filled while others go unanswered. In my opinion, Florida did not nearly request enough supplies for what their infection rates are going to be, and I can see this as expected as they continue to be incompetent in social distancing and closing of businesses. This could very well explain why they have received 100% of their requests, likely filled by Fauchi and Pence, based on infections and population size, and not by Trump himself - Because they’re underestimating the problem and the solution. Cuomo Finds Balance Governor Andrew Cuomo famously continues requesting 30,000 ventilators which the HHS does not have in the stockpile, as of the press conference on March 30, there were 10,000 there and 100,000 more were being built by companies like GM, GE, &amp; Ford due to be delivered over 100 days. Trump also makes an interesting note during the press briefing claiming “I’m just staying this if they’re holding, let me give you one example, we sent thousands of generators to New York, they were put into a warehouse a New York warehouse that happened to be located interestingly in Edison NJ, they were given to NY and we then went to other places also giving thousands of ventilators, the people in NY never distributed the generators, we said why didn’t you distribute em? Now you have to understand, they have New York people working in those warehouses, they knew that had em so we said why didn’t you distribute them, I hope they have distributed 7 them now, but maybe they didn’t need em so badly, but just so you know we’re all you, me everybody, we’re all on the same team,” So wait, if this is true, why are these ventilators* sitting in warehouses? Lets turn to governor Cuomo for the answer to this question. Cuomo has been mayor of New York for decades, and I believe either the money, or the power got to him as he secretly helped republicans in in the past to gain re election, because there are not two parties, there is only money and corporate donors : NY POST SOURCE The reality is this: Cuomo knows that the ventilators are there, and likely wants to distribute them, but he has a problem; he need to balance his budget. The New York State budget has been going awry for years now and Cuomo is dealing with a $6billion deficit in the 2020-21 year. A problem which needs to be handled promptly, even in the midst of a pandemic. In mid March, Cuomo created a special task force to find the cuts that need to be made, and the result of this task force under Cuomo’s discretion was that to balance the budget, they would proceed with cuts to education, medicaid, and potentially other critical services, leaving previous years tax cuts which include, stock buybacks, a wealth tax, on yachts, and on private jets, firmly in place, continuing to favor the wealthy. Cuomo’s task force is named the Medicaid reform team, and is staffed by people who should not be serving in government due to what is called the “Revolving door ban” which outlaws people who work for the government leaving their positions to immediately lobby it for private firms. Cuomo bent this rule during the pandemic to exclude volunteers or contractors and has hired those who have been referred to as his allies. This medicaid reform team during the week of March 23, released their plan to continue the cutting of $2.5 billion from medicaid, Sean Petty of the NY nurses association says in an interview Cuomo is single handedly responsible for understaffing hospitals, and eliminating 20,000 beds over the last twenty years. Which falls in line with Trumps consistent criticism of Cuomo for not purchasing thousands of ventilators years ago to keep up with population growth when he had the chance. For several days now, Cuomo and his team have been moving forward with the Cuts to Medicaid but have ben having difficulties, likely being blocked by literally everyone in the NY legislature, and it most likely will not succeed, because NY state needs that $2.5 billion in Medicaid to fight the coronavirus right now! $9 Billion Delayed So, what’s the problem with the warehouse, we’ve seen all this before, tax cuts for the rich, even in the state with the largest income distribution and wealth disparity, but what does it have to do with the pandemic? Here is this issue for governor Cuomo, and why he has not released the ventilators from the warehouse; anything delivered from the HHS is considered federal aid from the government, in this case from Medicaid, and states cannot receive federal funds if they are cutting medicaid on a state level. Lets make that clear, IF he cuts 2.5 billion in Medicaid from NY state, that will make NY ineligible for the 6.7 Billion in coronavirus Aid the federal government is offering, this is one of the strings, attached, he 8 can’t cut medicaid if he wants that 6.7 billion. Yet he is still attempting to move forward, effectively blocking more than $9 Billion dollars of medical supplies in a time of pandemic. I don’t believe trump knew the full story as to why those ventilators in New Jersey weren’t distributed to NY, but I do believe this is the reason. We will see what happens, but he shouldn’t be able to get away with this. The Defense Production Act In a part which I skipped over, Trump praises private firms like GM who announced on March 20 that they would partner with various private sector firms to make masks and ventilators for the Covid19 response. This was two days after Trump enacted the Defense production act but did not use it. He changed his ming on the 27th when he officially commanded GM to make ventilators. Of course this timeline conveniently allowed the largest corporate bailout bill in the worlds history - $4.5 trillion to be passed through the senate on Wednesday the 25th securing an anonymous fund free from oversight which treasury secretary and former Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin can do what he want’s with. The “wins” that the progressives are touting as having made it into the bill - like the ban on stock buybacks - can be waived at Mnuchin’s discretion, and Public Citizen calls this “Jaw-dropping corruption.” Officially the bill gives roughly $250Billion in direct payments to the American people, $250 billion to expand unemployment benefits, and $4trillion to businesses in bail out dollars. Two days later Trump used the Defense production act to command those companies to build ventilators - and they’re still paying for them! Don’t forget the American people receive $1200 while their rent is deferred for three months, meaning that four months of rent will be due in July in one lump sum. Economists estimate that anywhere from 20% to 30% of people will loose their jobs, and many more homes will be foreclosed on similarly to 2008 when Obama was unable to prevent, and even fueled the fire as 9 million people lost their homes. So the same banks which are receiving $1trillion per day from the federal reserve to be bailed out, will still be kicking people out of their homes in July because the American people get $1200 while Wells Fargo splits $1 trillion per day with the richest corporations, and people on the planet, because the federal reserve has decided they’re bailing out individuals as well. Something unseen even in 2008. March 30, GE workers walk out demanding they make ventilators instead of whatever home domestic products they had been working on. If there were ever a time for workers and labour unions to demand healthcare be decoupled from your paycheck, a raise in minimum wage according to cost of living, and a universal basic income, all things found to benefit the people within societies far more than the richest 1%, this would be it. I looked to Bernie Sanders, to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, to Elizabeth Warren, Ilhan Omar, Andrew Yang, Rashida Talib, the progressive body with any actual power within government and they were saying nothing. Bernie Sanders gives a nice speech but ultimately says we should probably compromise this time and wait for a better time, then votes for the bill 9 On another note, Biden vs Cuomo Biden offers Buttigeig a spot in his cabinet possibly in exchange for endorsement which is illegal (but I have not seen proof of this as of yet because I think this is just common and people stopped caring) Biden is still for some reason being propped up by everyone in the media and by former democrat candidates who choose to ignore the woman he raped, and call her a liar (even try to smear her as a Russian agent lol) when literally she has more evidence than the victim of Kavanaugh had. With the conservative Trump appointee Supreme Court Justice accused of rape at a young age, the media literally went on for days starting a campaign known today as “#believe her” and now unfortunately the democrats do not #believeher because it’s a one way road. This accusation of Biden, one of many, was when he was already holding a position in office, and comes at an inconvenient time for the democrats as he is once again running for the “senate… or - you know the thing.” His accuser tried to come forward multiple times in past years and was shamed for doing so, then again in recent months, the went to Times Up one of the main organizations that investigates sexual assault in the workplace, unfortunately they refused to investigate this back in January because as they claim “Biden is a candidate running for office, so we cannot investigate him as it may jeopardize out nonprofit status” which is an obvious and unstated loophole in itself (which has apparently been contradicted by other lawyers in past precedent, but furthermore, Time’s Up’s PR organization is SKD nickerbocker which happens to be lead by Anita Dunn who is….drumroll please… - Joe Biden’s Campaign manager. But in the end, all this this is all not in fact a problem for them, because the party has already won the race by excluding Sanders who refuses to stand up for himself as Tulsi used to until she endorsed Joe Biden, as Yang has who also sold out to CNN. Bernie will soon do the forced rallying behind Biden as proclaimed by the DNC as well, in due time he will support him to the dismay of all their enthusiastic supporters; if either of them does not die of coronavirus first. This all comes at a time when we could have used Bernies Healthcare proposals, Tulsi’s anti war capital reinvestments at home, and Yang’s economic proposals which have all literally been in some way or another implemented in a time of crisis. becoming such a in such a disappointment to myself and all their anti corrupt, anti corporatist supporters) would have tried to reform wall street. Just mentioning all this at the end here because the NYT, CNN, Washington Post, NBC etc. are propping up Cuomo to replace Joe Biden that is if Hillary, or Michelle doesn’t step in first. And I think it’s very possible that the DNC could declare a brokered convention over biden then replace him with Cuomo, something that almost happened to Jessie Jackson with Cuomo’s father. Still aiming to write more on the progressive block’s unwillingness to stand up to the DNC, and stop attacking each other. 10 I am sure I’m crazy, but these people are just as crazy as I am. - Tyler 11</p>
