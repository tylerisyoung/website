<p>Steelmanning the case for antivaxxers.</p>
<p>There are two types of antivaxxers, those that don’t understand the science, and those that don’t believe in science. There are many reasons to be concerned about Covid, we are familiar with those, however the general consensus today is that the vaccines are entirely harmless and safe, however this is seemingly not the case after a review of the available peer reviewed literature on the topic. I do not report on this topic joyously, I wish it were absolutely clear that the vaccines were safe and effective, and while in the short term it is fairly clear that they are not causing outsized harm or short term damage, it is clear that there is an increasing number of papers being published these past few months suggesting that we should take a closer look at their administration. I for one do not understand why the antivax community is so focused on Bill Gates, Sorros and the like when there is legitimate evidence for vaccine and spike protein enduced harm within the peer reviewed literature, and I think it’s always good to give the other side the benefit of the doubt, therefore this is the srtongest case I can make for the harm of vaccines, and ultimately I believe that more data collection and analysis is warranted, and ultimately I believe Ivermectin should play a larger role than the vaccines themselves.</p>
<p>It is clear that covid is causing brain fog, and fatigue, which would seem clear from any illness, but it gets more interesting when considering the signs of aging, premature aging, one measurement of aging includes that of the fallability of the Blood-Brain barrier (BBB). Senatorov et al. explain the significance of this barrier in a study on mice; “Albumin was effectively absent from the hippocampus of young mice but was first detectable in the aging hippocampus starting as early as 12 months (“middle age”) and consistently elevated in aging up to 2 years, near the end of the life span. These results indicate that BBB dysfunction appears earlier than has been appreciated, placing it among the earliest known indicators of aging in the rodent brain.&quot; The study goes on to state that one of the major challenges in treating or delaying the onset of neurological disorders is that by the time they are recognized, the dysfunctions and degeneration are often no longer reversible (with treatments like fasting) and therefore treatment and prevention of further damage is also limited.</p>
<p>As early as April 30th, 2021 it was discovered that the spike protein causes damage to the lungs and other organs, regardless of origin, being natural infection, or the synthesis of the spike protein from vaccine in order to prime the immune system. Either method has the same resulting spike protein in our bloodstream and causes some level of immune response. Lei et al. find; “Although the use of a noninfectious pseudovirus is a limitation to this study, our data reveals that S protein alone can damage endothelium, manifested by impaired mitochondrial function and eNOS activity but increased glycolysis. It appears that S protein in ECs increases redox stress which may lead to AMPK deactivation, MDM2 upregulation, and ultimately ACE2 destabilization.” Endothelium are cells which line organs including the heart and all of our blood vessels, it was previously unknown, or unproven that covid spike protein impairs the functionality of the mitochondria of these cells. They conclude by saying; “By uncovering a foundational mechanism linking BBB decline to neural dysfunction, our study raises several critical questions: What causes BBB decline itself? Is BBB decline causal to, concurrent with, or an outcome of (or independent from) other well-known mecha- nisms of aging such as inflammation, reactive oxidation stress and metabolic failures, proteasome senescence, DNA damage, etc. … we show that BBB dysfunction may be an early step causing or contributing to activation of astrocytes and the ensuing inflammatory response. Similarly …We show that extravasation of albumin through the leaky BBB and astrocytic uptake may be one of the earliest steps that induce this age-related TGF cascade.” This conclusive connection between the loss in strength of the BBB and aging would naturally lead to our age related afflictions like that of alsheimers or stroke which are interrelated with the ACE2 receptor of cells.</p>
<p>Pena-Silva and Heistad suggest that the ACE2 receptor plays a protective role in the pathopsychology of cerebrovascular disease and stroke, their model suggests that shortly after a stroke, ACE2 activity in the brain increases, and for the days following, ACE2 continues to increase and remain elevated for three days, and they suggest that the presence of ACE2 is acting as a protective function of the brain. The opposite seems to be occuring in relation to alsheimers, in which ACE2 is not present, and therefore not providing any protective function for the brain, Kehoe et al. find, “ACE-2 enzyme activity is reduced in Alzheimer’s disease in association with increasing Aβ load and tau pathology ACE-2 activity was significantly reduced by approximately 50% in the mid-frontal cortex in AD compared with age-matched controls (P &lt; 0.0001). ACE-2 varied according to disease severity” We therefore now can presume that ACE2 plays some still relatively unknown roll in protecting the brain itself.</p>
<p>An experiment on covid patients by Buzhdygan et al. cfound, “when compared to the control, the dementia cases had an average of 3.5 ± 0.29 fold increase in ACE2 expression and the hypertension cases indicated a 5.1 ± 0.32 fold in ACE2 expression. The results demonstrate that the main target of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is expressed in the brain vasculature and it also appears to be upregulated in underlying health conditions known to worsen COVID- 19 outcomes.” This tells us a number of things, first, that the the spike protein is crossing the blood brain barrier, and additionally that ACE2 is being upregulated in ways that are consistent with the time period following a storke.</p>
<p>Additionally, a paper published by Byram and Bridle on June 15, 2021 finds four major concerns with the spike protein, and allude to a fifth complication of the crossing of the blood brain barrier, &quot;In lay language, proteins like the spike protein, not the intact virus, appear to mediate</p>
<p>much of the damage in the body in people who suffer from severe COVID-19. When the spike protein binds to these receptors, there are several events that can take place:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Proteins (called ‘complement proteins’) that are part of our innate immune system can get activated, causing inflammation that can damage or destroy the cells lining blood vessels and/or platelets34. Platelets that are required for clotting of blood also express ACE2 receptors that can bind with spike protein with dire consequences. Damage and destruction of platelets can cause their numbers to go down (a condition known as “thrombocytopenia”), and if platelet counts get too low and blood vessels are damaged, bleeding cannot be stopped. Therefore, the spike protein can potentiate bleeding.</p></li>
<li><p>Binding of the spike protein to platelets can also cause the platelets to become activated35. Activated platelets tend to clump, which can lead to the formation of clots. There is evidence that the spike protein can interact with other proteins in the blood to promote clotting36. As such, the spike protein can promote blood clotting.</p></li>
<li><p>Spike proteins binding to the cells that line our blood vessels can cause these cells to express proteins (known as ‘caspases’) that can cause the cells to die33. This is similar to findings from the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak where the spike protein from the original SARS-CoV could cause cells to die when it was being manufactured inside of them37. Dying cells that have been manufacturing the vaccine-encoded spike protein would release free spike protein or portions thereof.</p></li>
<li><p>Spike proteins binding to the cells that line our blood vessels can cause these cells to over- produce cell-signalling cytokines that can potentially contribute to dangerous ‘cytokine storms’ (overly robust and severe inflammation)33, 38.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Of additional concern is the knowledge that the spike protein is capable of dissociating into two parts and these smaller subunits (S1 and S2) can cross the blood-brain barrier where they can potentially cause damage in the brain39. Indeed, people who have died from severe COVID- 19 with neurological signs were found to have the spike proteins but not the intact virus in their brains40. These neurological signs could be seen in laboratory studies when spike proteins were injected into the blood of mice.&quot;</p>
<p>So if the spike protein is known to cause endothelial damage - regardless of origin natural infection, or vaccine - to blood vessels and therefore other organs, and has the ability to cross the holy blood brain barrier, where else does the spike protein deposit itself?</p>
<p>There was a leaked study from Pfizer Japan which was never released, and while the data is not conclusive, it certainly warrants more extensive testing, ideally on humans, instead of rats, and for a timeframe beyond 48 hrs. The quotes from this study are both translated from Japanese and unedited, the study concludes; “Other than the site of administration, the liver was the highest and then detected in the spleen, adrenal and ovaries, Total radioactivity recovery for dosages in these tissues was significantly lower than the liver.This result is In-mouse biological distribution tests were encoded by luciferase expression in liver.In addition, No toxic findings were observed showing liver injury in rat repeated dose toxicity tests” So while they seem to feel the need to mention the injection site which is muscle tissue and therefore unlikely to be too problematic, but also mention: The Liver, which is used to dealing with toxins, that’s what it’s therefore; The Spleen of which the same can be said; The adrenal glands, which regulate blood pressure, the immune system, and our stress response; and The Ovaries. As these are in order of decreasing concentration, this measurement was as shown in their figure, the largest values of the right hand portion measuring the highest percentages of Lipid Nano Particles from the vaccine (percentage of administered dose) which the spike protein binds to and therefore becomes fat soluble and can be transported and recognized in different portions of the body.</p>
<p>Reuters gives an interesting (meaning somewhat false) debunking of this article when they and their interviewed experts claim, “Research shows that spike proteins (here) remain stuck to the cell surface around the injection site and do not travel to other parts of the body via the bloodstream, they added. The 1% of the vaccine that does reach the bloodstream is destroyed by liver enzymes” They are mostly correct about this, however it is easy to see how news can be manipulated as this remains true only at the time of injection, and for the first 15 minutes, at any time measured thereafter, more than 1% of the LNP have left the injection site for other parts of the body, and it’s not clear that these have been filtered by the liver.</p>
<p>I am not proclaiming to be an expert in any of this, hence my heavy useage of quotation, though tt’s easy to see how word games and preordained conclusions could play a role in the medias reporting of a scientific study that most won’t read. For reference, the percent of administered dose was measured at 0.25 hrs, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4, hr 8 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr. The only categories at &gt;1% of administered dose were that of the injection site which remained high around 20-52% of the dose of LNP, similarly, the liver was increasing across that time period from 0.6% of dose at 1 hr to 16.2% at 48 hrs. the Reuters claim also missed that the SPLEEN is also increasing, and at 48 hrs the concentration level was &gt;1% of dose, But it’s not just percentage of dose which matters, it’s concentration of LNP within each organ tissue which maybe problematic, the fact that these particles are very tiny and have the ability to find their way into places which we are not familiar with yet is a known risk, and yet to be quantified, furthermore they are nonsoluable and will remain in the body indefinitely. The injection site can likely handle it’s 24.6% of the dose at 48 hrs, and the liver can hopefully handle its 16.2% of the dose at 48 hrs, but can the large intestine handle it’s 0.762% of the dose, can the testicles handle their 0.074%, can the ovaries handle their 0.095%? It’s not certain that these organs can handle these ammounts, and it’s also possible that the LNP will forever have a nonzero presence in these organs. It is fortunate that the study itself found that there were no abnormalities on any oorgans, and reproduction was not problematic, though it’s important to note the complete avoidance of the left portion of the figure by prominent (twitter) virologists and Reuters when discussing the mean total lipid concentration by organ, which does seem more relevant; How concentrated by weight the LNP are in each organ based on the size of that organ, rather than just the percentage of the dose they absorbed.</p>
<p>In this case, the mean concentrations becomes a little more nuanced as we have no idea what the accute concentration rates mean at these doses in these areas of the body, but I would suggest that it’s important to notice the trend in the total concentration across some of these tissues: They’re all increasing over the course of 48 hrs until they stopped taking measurements aside from that of the injection site and the blood. The same goes for the previously mentioned percentage of the injection fluid, all increasing up until 48 hours aside from that of the spinal cord (blood was not measured).</p>
<p>Furthermore, by weight the ovaries rank highest in terms of concentration at 48 hrs, having 12.3 mg of LNP/Gram of ovary only behind the liver and the adrenal glands, while this whole study is somewhat misleading as the timeframe ends at a period, we do in fact have data suggesting that the percentage dose AND dose per organ weight is increasing across all parts of the body at 48 hours, and in Reuters article titled “Fact Check-No evidence spike proteins from COVID-19 vaccines are toxic,” this remains true, there is no evidence that these levels are toxic, yet it does no justice in developing the understanding of the average reader, and in fact may do more harm than good.</p>
<p>In another recent April, 2021 article by Igyarto et al. investigating specifically the offsite effects of Lipid Nano Particles, they begin with both caution and optimism, “The advantages of using LNPs for vaccines are numerous. In addition to being a safer alternative to viral vectors for the delivery of mRNA vaccines, LNPs are self-adjuvating and highly customizable. Furthermore, the LNP-mRNA platform can be manufactured on a large scale and adapted easily to emerging pathogens. Also, the recent development of thermostable variants [2] will overcome the necessity of cold-chain storage, which is required to different degrees for the current mRNA-LNP based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, because this is a new approach for human vaccination, with different levels of reported side-effects there remain many unknowns and caveats that should be considered.”</p>
<p>Their study found that it is possible the effects of the LNP’s remaining in the system could lead to increased chances of a cytokine storm where the healthy immune system begins attacking itself, “Any cell presenting anti- genic determinants from the vaccine could become a target of T cell-mediated killing.” They claim that this is in part thew reason why adverse effects form the vaccines were reported after the second vaccination, and correlated with higher dosages. These adverse response syymptoms include things like headache, and brain fog which could be due to the spike protein crossing the blood brain barrier and inducing an ACE2 response, the brain reacting in a manner similar to after having a stroke. It is also important to note that most agree that whatever these adverse symptoms are, they are likely heavily underreported. Most people with a headache to not bother to seek out and report it to any authority. Though these authors are now suggesting another potential pathway for harm by LNP concentration in cells triggering T-cell killing and potentially invigorating inflammation and/or a cytokine storm which becomes especially problematic in those with preexisting conditions.</p>
<p>The authors suggest immediate changes to the current form of MRNA vaccines in order to make them safer, “For this purpose LNPs should be conjugated to DC-targeting antibodies or ligands, such as anti-Langerin, anti-CLEC9A, anti- DEC205, mannose, and so on, …Therefore, we would propose tailoring the vaccine’s route of administration to the pathogen’s natural route of infection and developing intranasal vaccines for respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2,” and they conclude with further caution yet reinforce the suggestion for the alteration of the current vaccine administration.</p>
<p>Another interesting phenomenon I came across was that of Dr. Robert Malone, one of the core inventors or discoverers of MRNA technology, who has deep concerns over today’s Distributed Idea Suppression Complex (DISC) in the medical field and claims that we should both be far more cautious with the MRNA vaccines, and far less cautious with prescribing the known to be safe prophylaxis treatment of covid with ivermectin. He quotes from a recently published paper stating “Every vaccine causes two deaths but prevents three.” and on twitter he writes, “Once again I feel it necessary to make a clear and unambiguous statement. The data strongly indicate that the experimental genetic vaccines have saved lives. Many lives. But it is also clear that there are some risks associated with these vaccines.” The paper he mentions was published by Walach et al. in June of 2021, and their conclusion is that, “This lack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy.” To prove this, they conducted cost benefit analysis on trial data, combined with Israeli vaccination data, two of the most sound sources for the world, their findings were, “Currently, our estimates show that we have to accept four fatal and 16 serious side effects per 100,000 vaccinations in order to save the lives of 2–11 individuals per 100,000 vaccinations, placing risks and benefits on the same order of magnitude. Finally, we note that from experience with reporting side effects from other drugs, only a small fraction of side effects is reported to adverse events databases. The median underreporting can be as high as 95%. Given this fact and the high number of serious side effects already reported, the current political trend to vaccinate children who are at very low risk of suffering from COVID-19 in the first place must be reconsidered.”&quot; This result precisely is why Robert Malone, the inventor of MRNA vaccines himself is a greater advocate of ivermectin than he is vaccines.</p>
<p>While I continue to believe the hype that the vaccines are overall a good thing for society, this information certainly does bring some pause to my advocacy of vaccinating especially the elderly, immunocompromised, and those with compounding preconditions, let alone those who are young, and/or healthy. I am similarly more pro ivermectin than I am pro vaccine, though I think thee world needs both, to reach heard immunity, and I believe we should do that as quickly as possible. India has shown some promising results from ivermectin and this gives rise to much needed hope in my book. We also need rigorous and open debate without fear of speaking out against the grain, or cancellation, these are the fundamentals of free speech which will always lead to better public health.</p>
