<p><strong><em>Global economic outlook is the worst it has been since
1929</em></strong></p>
<p>Given the USD global reserve currency status, all eyes are on the fed
who’s DXY dollar index is sucking liquidity from every other global
currency, there are only two ways out, one goes up, and the other goes
down. Until we see the path resolved, our economy will remain in a
downward trending stagflation.</p>
<p>Is the fed done hiking? The math on total debt and interest along
with the credit impulse markets say yes. Powell still needs unemployment
and housing signals to come down <em>significantly</em> before
attempting any sort of pivot, or at least pause in rate hikes. Analysts
are saying that they’ll pile in at SPX 3500 if we get there, but it’s
rare to see perfect entries in times of great fear. Look out below &amp;
stack cash for some great PE entries. Otherwise a verbal pivot will
signal that we’re going up from here, Nasdaq and Bitcoin will be the
first to rebound. Either way, we could see an october surprise i.e. bear
market rally leading into midterm elections and the endgame that comes
after, whatever that may be.</p>

<p><br> <em>7/1/2022</em> <br></p>
<p><strong><em>Atlanta Fed Confirms that we are about to enter a
Recession</em></strong></p>
<p>Most economists use the 10-2 year yield spread and curve to predict
upcoming recessions, however the fed today is using the 10 year - 3
month spread. This is likely because it will be the last to flash the
warning sign of recession and allow Biden to say things like “We have a
very strong economy” as GDP continues to slow.</p>
<p>The NY Fed tells us that, “This model uses the slope of the yield
curve, or “term spread,” to calculate the probability of a recession in
the United States twelve months ahead. Here, the term spread is defined
as the difference between 10-year and 3-month Treasury rates.”</p>
<p>The only tool the Fed has to combat high inflation is raising
interest rates, typically ABOVE the rate of inflation, as should have
been done a year ago when the economy was stronger in order to avoid the
stagflation we’re seeing today. Higher interest rates mean a stronger
dollar, and higher interest rates as term duration increases on bonds -
a normal and healthy yield curve which rewards people for saving their
money in cash longer.</p>
<p>The real rate of return when accounting for inflation on any of these
bonds is currently several points in the negative due to price
inflation, therefore the Fed needs to continue raising rates until
inflation calms down from demand destruction and yields on risk free
treasuries trends back towards sensible returns. Until this happens, we
will continue to see other currencies fall in value compared to the US
Dollar denominated hegemony - “The Dollar Milkshake”.</p>
<p>The Fed is far behind the curve, and the government’s interest
payments on $30 Trillion dollars of debt and much more in foreign
obligations, will ensure that the Fed remains behind the curve, actually
favoring inflation that goes unnoticed in order to inflate away the
debt, the only way out is through a hard landing, a deep recession, or
returning to Quantitative Easing in order to simply kick the can down
the road. This last option of QE is unfortunately not on the table at
the moment because the money printing is what got us here in the first
place.</p>

<p><strong><em>Energy Price Inflation Soars in Germany and around the
World</em></strong></p>
<p>Americans <a
href="https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/News/326998-2022-06-12-americans-owe-22-billion-in-late-utility-bills-as-energy.htm">owe</a>
$22 billion in already late utility bills as energy costs in the US rise
34% YOY.</p>
<p>Europe, more directly affected by the Russia Ukraine War has it much
worse, Germany specifically is has experienced a 6X increase in the cost
of baseload power since 2020. They managed this by increasing their
reliance on Russian oil and gas along with shortsighted energy policies
and adherence to the ESG narrative at the expense of their own
fragility.</p>
<p>In 2020 Germany’s percentage usage of renewables <a
href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/10/is-germany-making-too-much-renewable-energy/">was</a>
46%, largely coming from wind, solar, and hydro electric. The remainder
of their energy was from coal, gas, oil, and nuclear.</p>
<p>Despite still struggling to meet their stringent carbon related
policies, and despite the now soaring energy costs, Germany has recently
upheld the pledge to continue with the shut down their remaining nuclear
reactors by the end of 2022, a decision that was decided a decade prior,
in the wake of the Fukishima disaster in Japan.</p>
<p>The German government has also pledged to phase out coal - but not
until 2038. This series of moves has ensured that their baseload energy
consumption is actually getting more carbon intensive, not less. These
choices, alongside western imposed Russian sanctions which have
increased natural gas prices globally leave the German’s supply of
baseload power insufficient for meeting modern expectations or
demand.</p>
<p>Germany’s Vice Chancellor <a
href="https://wattsupwiththat.com/2022/06/26/germany-green-energy-crisis-warns-of-lehman-like-contagion/">warned</a>
of a “Lehman like” economic collapse due to their current energy policy,
and we are seeing it play out in fast and slow motion.</p>
<p>Germany is extremely close to <a
href="https://www.businessinsider.co.za/germany-says-energy-crisis-may-trigger-lehman-like-contagion-2022-6">rationing</a>
stores of natural gas, and suggesting it will start with hot water, a
luxury some of those living in energy poverty have already forsaken
despite their middle class incomes. Today, likely more than 23% of
German people are suffering some form of <a
href="http://www.enpover.eu/en/energy-poverty">“Energy Poverty”</a>
where a significant enough portion of their income goes towards energy,
causing them to cut back on other necessities.</p>
<p>With prices so high, and natural gas stockpiles at record low levels,
the German Government has <a
href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/04/19/germany-wont-stop-buying-russian-gas-should-face-sanctions/">announced</a>
that they will re-establish the use of previously decommissioned
coal-fired power plants. Coal is far easier to bring back online than
nuclear, so any future hiccups will likely see expansion of this more
carbon intense base energy.</p>
<p>German wholesale oil is up ~70% YOY, and even an end to the war
wouldn’t mean that western nations return to direct purchases from
Russia, therefore these price increases are likely to remain.</p>
<p>Furthermore,UK newspaper The Telegraph <a
href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/04/19/germany-wont-stop-buying-russian-gas-should-face-sanctions/">suggests</a>
that if Germans won’t stop buying Russian gas, they too should face
sanctions.</p>
<p>Lastly, Reuters reports that; Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Bulgaria,
and Romania have joined Germany’s finance minister in opposing the 2035
mandate to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. This move, is
postponed would all but ensure that the EU does not meet it’s target of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels before
2030.</p>
<p>Many across the globe will be priced out of the green energy
revolution.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update to the Japan Crisis</em></strong></p>
<p>Japan’s Ponzi Scheme is running out of time. Japan has 12.8 Trillion
on the BOJ’s balance sheet and their current debt/GDP is nearly
200%.</p>
<p>They have apparently reached their limit to perform Yield Curve
Control in both the bond and stock market with newly printed treasuries
which cannot find the buyers necessary to prop up the Yen’s purchasing
power against USD. A panic spike in selling lead to Bond yields jumping
up above the governments mandated ability to continue QE driven
purchases without becoming insolvent with a debt/gdp ratio too high.
Market participants selling bonds lead to higher interest payments for a
government that cannot afford it. <br> <img

<hr />
<p><br> <em>6/9/2022</em> <br></p>
<p><strong><em>Japanese Yen spirals against US dollar, the consequences
of endless QE</em></strong> <br></p>
<p>Japan has been the canary in the coal mine for the last decade,
forecasting where us in the US and western nations who are participating
in Quantitative Easing might end up. Japan has apparently reached its
limits in how far they can go before trust in assets held on the central
bank’s balance sheet is lost.</p>
<p>Japan’s debt/GDP ratio is nearly 200%, the highest of any nation in
the world.</p>
<p><img src="Journalism/Economics/ongoingta/6-9-2022_2.jpg" /></p>
<p><br></p>
<iframe src="https://data.worldbank.org/share/widget?end=2016&amp;indicators=GC.DOD.TOTL.GD.ZS&amp;locations=JP&amp;start=1990&amp;view=chart" width="450" height="300" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no">
</iframe>
<p><br></p>
<p>With a debt/GDP ratio this high, the government technically owes
money to itself through the central bank’s deficit printing. The problem
with having so much debt is the interest rates. Once interest rates
begin to rise, so do interest payments needed to remain solvent. Without
a robust and increasing GDP for taxpayer generated income for the
government to fund the debt, the only option becomes - devalue the debt
denominated in fiat currency which has no limitations to creation -
inflate it away.</p>
<p>When the M2 money stock goes up, each dollar held by citizens and the
government goes down when measured against other commodities, or other
currencies which will remain stronger if they are not also printing more
money, though the debt, taken out years, even decades ago remains the
same. The debt positions can thus continually be serviced with newly
created money that has a lesser value, and the longer a nation waits to
pay off the debt, the cheaper it becomes.</p>
<p>A true sovereign debt crisis occurred in Greece when their debt was
denominated in Euros, instead of their own former Greek currency, the
drachma. Since the Greek centrral bank could not control the newly
issued wupply of Euros, regulated by the ECB, we saw them enter a period
of default where their debts needed to be written down in lieu of a
western humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>Central Banks like Japan, or the United States who can self fund have
the advantage especially when interest rates are low, but when entering
a period of tightening, and slower economic growth, or even stagflation
as we are now, the only tool to create demand destruction and thus lower
inflation would traditionally be - raising interest rates to the rate of
inflation.</p>
<p>The problem with an inflationary environment is that to solve the
problem of inflation, it is all but mandatory to cease the creation of
more dollars. Volker of the FED solved this problem in the 70’s by
raising rates to match the rate of inflation which was above 10% at the
time. The only problem with doing that now is that we have too much
debt.</p>
<p>If the US or Japan raised rates this high, to 8-16% to match the
current inflation rate, the governments would not be able to finance the
interest payments on the debt, and would thus default.</p>
<p>But they can’t print more money either, so it’s necessary to rely on
jawboning all markets into demand destruction without raising rates, and
so far it’s working.</p>
<p>If this is not effective enough, the US will need to follow Japan’s
lead, by implementing Yield Curve Control (YCC).</p>
<p>The aim of YCC is to craft a particular shape to the yield rates on
bonds issued by the government. When any entity including individuals
are holding treasuries issued by the government, they should be expected
to at least retain their value, furthermore, the longer duration of the
bond, the higher the expected yield, but with inflation, this becomes a
problem.</p>
<p>Therefore, it has become necessary for the Bank of Japan to
participate in yield curve control, printing money to directly purchase
bonds and prop up the market. In addition to this, the BOJ is also
purchasing stocks on the open market as well, something previously
unheard of.</p>
<p>This has a two pronged effect; firstly is staves off insolvency for
Japan, for now, they are able to service their debt’s on the balance
sheet with new dollars, but secondly, it has eroded trust, and yield
from all of their markets is gone leading investors to seek yield
elsewhere.</p>
<p>If this persists, a debt driven deflationary spiral that leads to
insolvency could follow, and it could be both abrupt, and catastrophic
as it was for Greece who needed a bailout from the ECB.</p>
<p>Japan’s 10 year yield has been below the US 10 year yield for a
decade now leaving less access to liquidity for paying off debts, but
also Japan’s stock market has not reached a new all time high since
1990, in fact, it’s still down 26% from that date. Money is fleeing the
country and GDP will remain low, threatening insolvency
indefinitely.</p>
<p>The Japanese Yen is loosing value compared to the dollar, but the
Dollar is loosing value compared to commodities and will inevitably face
the same fate if we continue the current regime.</p>

<p><em>6/7/2022</em> <br> <strong><em>Federal Reserve Releases Hilarious
Hit Piece on Bitcoin</em></strong></p>
<p>The FED has <a
href="https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2022/06/buying-eggs-with-bitcoins/">released</a>
a chart comparing Bitcoin’s purchasing power against the price of
supermarket eggs. They suggest that this is the reason Bitcoin is not a
good store of value.</p>
<p>This is the chart presented. <br> <img
src="Journalism/Economics/ongoingta/6-7-2022_1.jpg" /> <br> It only
takes a moment to realize that the data is completely cherry picked from
the last two years, and if you choose to drag the view options back to
the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, their very same chart simply tells the
opposite story.</p>
<p>If you were to have held Bitcoin instead of US dollars for nearly any
period of Bitcoin’s existence, your purchasing power measured in eggs
would have only increased, and significantly. <br> <img
src="Journalism/Economics/ongoingta/6-7-2022_2.jpg" /> <br></p>
<p>The US dollar has lost 95% of it’s purchasing power against
commodities, goods, and services over the last several decades. It is
interesting however that the FED finds the need to attempt to make these
silly comparisons.</p>

2017 data, pre pandemic, pre money printing from the FED, and before war
in Ukraine, unfortunately it only get’s worse from here. <br>
Furthermore, fertilizer is made through a process invented by Fritz
Haber and Carl Bosch who is often credited alongside Norman Borlaug,
inventor of genetic modification, for being the catalysts of the “<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution">Green
Revolution</a>” in the late 50’s to which they are credited with saving
hundreds of millions of lives. Today, 50% of peoples food supply relies
on both genetic modification of staple food crops which are pest and
drought resistant, but also their growth is dependent on the Haber-Bosch
process which uses nitrogen fixation to produce ammonia. Previously,
many farmers would need to go through the season long process of
planting nitrogen fixing plants to revive this necessary chemical.
Today, it can be purchased in 1000LB+ quantities and applied at will.
This is how we currently feed the world. Cheap fertilizers that contain
ammonia are the reason the world population was able to move from 3
Billion people to nearly 8 Billion today.</p>
<p><br> Haber Bosch Process: {H^{}=-91.8~{}} <br> Historically
fertilizers have been cheap, relying firstly on the recent boom in
availability from the recent discovery of previously untappable oil
reserves, this, alongside the deflationary pressures of technology
evolution, lead to continually declining prices of methane (CH4) and
ultimately the manufacturing process of fertilizers.</p>
<p>Secondly, fertilizers are made from nitrogen as we know, but also
potassium and phosphorous, and Russia and Ukraine previously made up 28%
of all global fertilizer supply. Given equal and consistent demand as
farms tend to have, supply constraints will mean higher prices. <br>

Recently, after Russia’s foreign treasury reserve assets held
internationally were seized in the first ever occurrence of this sort
which pokes a hole in the supposedly unbiased petrodollar hegemony,
Russia retaliated by forcing purchasers of Oil and Gas to procure
Russian Rubles to make those purchases through Russian banks who were
cut off from the SWIFT network. This new demand for Rubles has caused it
to outperform the US dollar, gaining purchasing power, and leading to
higher prices on Natural Gas, of which Europe gets 40% of its gas from
Russia.</p>
<p>European citizens have been experiencing a condition known as being
“energy poor” where the average middle class family has all the modern
amenities that we have in the US for example, but cannot afford to heat
their homes, or use a hot water heater due to the skyrocketing prices of
natural gas, both over the last decade due to ratcheting carbon tax
tightening as well as the European Central Bank’s inflationary money
printing, both causing prices to rise for end consumers.</p>
<p>On top of that, Europe has sanctioned <a
href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-sanctions-higher-food-prices-potash/">fertilizers</a>
and from Russia and Belarus, which will also lead to inflationary prices
for end consumers. While France is the European country that has the
closest to a carbonized energy grid, made up of mostly nuclear, Germany
has recently decommissioned the last of the nuclear plants and replaced
their energy with mostly coal and natural gas from Russia. The German
society is now highly dependent on Russian gas, and a global divestment
from fossil fuels in general means that there is not much more supply
coming online for the next several years. <br> <img
src="Journalism/Economics/ongoingta/6-6-2022_2.png" /> <br> Together,
this makes up the perfect storm for higher input costs from lack of
fertilizers, and direct blockade of supplies from Russia, and now other
countries which refuse to export certain items like China who has been
accumulating food stores for years, now <a
href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Datawatch/China-hoards-over-half-the-world-s-grain-pushing-up-global-prices">hoarding</a>
half of the world’s grain. Malaysia is <a
href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3180039/malaysias-poultry-export-ban-when-will-it-end-how-have-people">banning</a>
the export of Chicken. Indonesia recently took to <a
href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/indonesian-palm-oil-export-ban-set-to-raise-indian-inflation-8405201.html">banning</a>
the export of Palm oil due to a poor harvest, which drives the price of
palm oil up. This price increase leads to more deforestation in the
amazon and southern Asia where palm oil is the majority of export crops,
but it also incentives wheat farmers in the US - another large wheat
producer- to flip and plant more soybeans for soybean oil instead of
wheat, again driving wheat prices higher. India <a
href="https://news.yahoo.com/us-urges-india-reverse-ban-083311676.html">bans</a>
the export of wheat. This is a problem because wheat is in basically all
the processed foods.</p>
<p>Joe Biden has been making the rounds to world leaders hoping to
convince them to increase supply and drive down prices. He offered India
$4 billion to export more wheat which they rejected. He asked Saudi
Arabia to export more oil which they said they couldn’t do due to
already tight supply constraints. We have such a significant problem
that America’s past actions and alliances can be ignored in the search
for more oil. We formerly accused Nicolas Maduro of both election fraud,
then later drug trafficking in order to attempt to <a
href="https://theintercept.com/2019/02/02/venezuela-us-trump-sanctions/">install</a>
the US-friendly Juan Guaido who never fully assumed <a
href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/why-venezuela-s-two-presidents-are-ready-to-talk-quicktake">power.</a>
Recently, Biden reached out to Maduro to try to procure more Venezuelan
oil that should have originally been destined for our largest refinery
owned by the Koch brothers in Corpus Christi, Texas. However, The
political blowback of a nation supposedly aligned with Russian interests
was nearly enough to shut down these talks, but it looks like we don’t
actually care about politics or what we used to call Russian aliance,
because it looks like Venezuelan oil may begin to be imported soon. This
is all a result of US involvement in the Russia Ukraine war when we
banned Russian oil imports to America.</p>
<p>We have no oil, we’ve released all of our strategic reserves, and we
dont have the wells, refineries, or infrastructure to bring supply
online to meet demand, therefore price must rise. Chevron’s CEO has <a
href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/chevrons-ceo-says-no-more-us-oil-refineries-what-should-energy-investors-do/ar-AAY6k1N?li=BBnbfcL">said</a>
that he does not see any new oil refineries ever coming back to the US.
This is in part due to the horrendous permitting and regulation process
which can take time measured in years, and money measured in the
millions, only to get approval, even nearly finish construction, costing
billions, to then have the project held up in court for another several
years and threaten its very completion. This is what happened to the
Mountain Valley Pipeline in Appalacia which contains our largest natural
gas reserves, and the Jordan Cove LNG pipeline in Oregon which
developers <a
href="https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2021/12/jordan-cove-developers-abandon-plans-for-pipeline-coos-bay-lng-terminal.html">abandoned.</a>
These projects are now sunk costs worth billions on investors balance
sheets, definitively scaring away any new investors.</p>
<p>The environmental movement has a process of blocking new fossil fuel
infrastructure that can sometimes be very effective. petitions,
protests, court appeals, biodiversity, larger environmental concerns,
damage from spills, air, noise, and unethical pollution, these things
are all excellent and effective tactics that the environmental movement
uses to block new fossil fuel infrastructure. The majority of the public
is simultaneously on the side of the environmentalists wanting to make
the world a batter place, but also desiring lower costs for gasoline at
the fuel pump. The pendulum has swung too far.</p>
<p>The realities of economics and commodity inflation have already
caught up with us and if we continue to invest in new fossil fuel
infrastructure, oil prices will increase and remain high due to
constrained supply. Of course, we also need to optimize out investments
in green tech as well because many of the environmentalists concerns are
warranted. Hoowever, renewables largely do not have the tech or the cost
effectiveness to outcompete oil in most places, the cost of EV’s and the
chips that run them are only going up due to all the supply shortages
caused by quantitative easing which is necessary to keep the US from a
debt driven collapse.</p>
<p>These intricate complexities only lead to regressive outcomes hurting
those who cannot afford green tech, while also demonizing them for their
supposed dirty emissions in what is quickly becoming a class divide
driven by inflation and market manipulation from the Federal Reserve. We
need to tackle climate change, but we don’t need to go overboard, and
what we’re doing right now is not necessary even according to the IPCC
and the IEA who don’t see any concerning tipping points until we reach a
global temperature over 4 degrees celsius, which they project us to
remain well under. Optimal policy is difficult, and the current two
sidedness and bias towards extremity in order to gain moderate results
is not helping. <br> <img
src="Journalism/Economics/ongoingta/6-6-2022_3.jpg" /> <br> Reshoring of
goods, services and commodities into our borders makes for a self
sufficient economy, but globalization and free trade make for cheaper
goods and a more diverse and growing global economy which predominantly
benefits developing nations, but we cannot have both sides of the
extreme. Privatization also matters, Venezuela is rich in oil, but poor
in their Bolivar’s exchange rate, nationalization does not work when the
government is allowed to continually operate at a loss, hyperinflation
has arrived for Venezuela, and will continue to increase across the
world as energy runs the show and the economy.</p>
<p>What was previously a perceived environmental win of slowing
investment in fossil fuel infrastructure is now causing mass starvation
for wage earners across the globe who cannot keep up with food price
inflation. Those consumers who will not or cannot pay, will be forced to
change their purchasing behavior and some will starve or become
malnourished for lack of cheap and healthy food. Famines are created not
by God, but by man.</p>
<p>The Food and Agricultural Organization price index tracking month
over month and year over year changes shows every key agricultural
product up significantly year over year as well as Cereal prices, which
includes wheat, up by 30%. Every food that contains wheat will need to
either rise by 30%, or the company selling it will need to choose to
take what is for them hopefully* a temporary* loss to keep their
customers.</p>
<p>In a United Nations press <a
href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2022/sc14894.doc.htm">Release</a>,
Antonio Gutierrez said, ““When war is waged, people go hungry…Most
important of all, we need to end the war in Ukraine.” The security
council quotes Antony J. Blinken, Secretary of State of the United
States, “Recalling WFP and FAO estimates that people affected by food
insecurity due to conflict would increase to an estimated 161 million in
2022, noted that the Russian Federation’s war in Ukraine could add
another 40 million people to that total. That country’s flagrant
disregard of resolution 2417 (2018) is just the latest example of a
Government using the hunger of civilians to advance its objectives. The
food supply for millions of Ukrainians and millions more around world
“has quite literally been held hostage by the Russian military”, he
said, noting 20 million tons of grain sit unused in Ukrainian silos as
food prices skyrocket.”</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br> Defense spending is both fine and desired, but war is bad for
business, let’s stop fighting and funding proxy wars that aren’t on our
soil. <br></p>
<p><img src="Journalism/Economics/ongoingta/6-6-2022_4.jpg" /> <img

<p><br><br />
There’s no use hoping inflation will come down, and producers know this,
the debt/GDP ratio shows us that it will continue for the rest of the
decade unless the US chooses to default or cause a recession which is
far worse than 1929 due the the amount of leverage across all markets.
Officials will never choose either of these options, they will always
choose inflation with short term periods of demand destruction as we’re
experiencing now. Macroeconomist Luke Gromen calls this “Peak Cheap
Oil.”</p>
<p>Shadow Stats is a company currently tracking CPI inflation much more
accurately than the massaged US government numbers, they do this by
using the US government’s former calculation methods instead of the new
ones which were recently changed several times to fit the narrative.
Currently Shadow Stats has inflation above 16%, much closer to prices in
the real world. Wheat inflation is now 30% year over year.</p>
<p>The healthy and reasonable way to fix this is to cause short term
demand destruction in financial markets and commodity futures today,
while the economy is still relatively strong and raise interest rates to
the rate of inflation - the Volker method. This alongside a significant
reduction in federal expenditure is necessary for the economy to recover
in real terms, instead of waiting for stagflation to continue, for a
recession to get worse, and only then attempting to raise rates into an
economy already in a depression. If the FED doesn’t pivot within the
year, this is where we’re headed. The FED is out of options, and not
only are they behind the curve, they are also late to the party and too
slow to act, and because of this people will starve.</p>

<strong><em>Federal Reserve Begins Quantitative Tightening
Today</em></strong><br />
<br></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Fed will begin selling UST’s and MBS’s. There are many
reasons for markets to buy US Treasuries, they are universal pristine
collateral across the world, but when the Fed begins selling Mortgage
Backed Securities, there becomes more supply of them, less demand for
their use as collateral, and there is only one buyer - pension funds
forced to purchase them by mandate to “reduce risk.” MBS interest rates
will increase as selling occurs and price goes down, and the housing
market will stall over time. The real risk comes when these investments
have negative real yields against inflation and pension funds begin to
fail unless they can adjust the regulations in order to find better
yields.</p></li>
<li><p>We only have one period of QT to base our expectations off in
2018, and we are now tightening into a slowing economy, interestingly
enough the S&amp;P actually was flat/went up slightly during the last
period of tightening.</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s see how far they get before something breaks. Last time
that happened was 2019 when it took a liquidity event in the reverse
repo market to abruptly end QT and reverse course to QE infinity.Covid
provided excellent cover for this, and climate change will provide the
next.</p></li>
<li><p>As M2 money supply increases, so does counter party risk on banks
balance sheets. If all the banks are holding are promises of payment,
trust can erode quickly. These banks are now (apparently) so concerned
that their formerly pristine assets - US treasuries and Mortgage backed
securities - will fail, potentially overnight, as happened in 2008 that
they are placing ever increasing amounts of risk on the balance sheet of
the Federal Reserve in the overnight repo market. The government will
print more money before they become insolvent.</p></li>

<p><strong>Biden’s Plan to Combat Inflation</strong><br />
<br> Biden wrote an op-ed for the Wall St Journal where he <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/my-plan-for-fighting-inflation-joe-biden-gas-prices-economy-unemployment-jobs-covid-11653940654">announces</a>
his three step plan to fight inflation. This is just after his <a
href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/10/the-biden-harris-inflation-plan-lowering-costs-and-lowering-the-deficit/">previous
plan</a> released just days ago.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The New Plan:</em><br />
</li>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>“First, the Federal Reserve has a primary responsibility to control
inflation. My predecessor demeaned the Fed, and past presidents have
sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of
elevated inflation. I won’t do this. I have appointed highly qualified
people from both parties to lead that institution. I agree with their
assessment that fighting inflation is our top economic challenge right
now.”</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>“Second, we need to take every practical step to make things more
affordable for families during this moment of economic uncertainty—and
to boost the productive capacity of our economy over time. The price at
the pump is elevated in large part because Russian oil, gas and refining
capacity are off the market. We can’t let up on our global effort to
punish Mr. Putin for what he’s done, and we must mitigate these effects
for American consumers. That is why I led the largest release from
global oil reserves in history. Congress could help right away by
passing clean energy tax credits and investments that I have proposed. A
dozen CEOs of America’s largest utility companies told me earlier this
year that my plan would reduce the average family’s annual utility bills
by $500 and accelerate our transition from energy produced by autocrats.
We can also reduce the cost of everyday goods by fixing broken supply
chains, improving infrastructure, and cracking down on the exorbitant
fees that foreign ocean freight companies charge to move products. My
Housing Supply Action Plan will make housing more affordable by building
more than a million more units, closing the housing shortfall in the
next five years. We can reduce the price of prescription drugs by giving
Medicare the power to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies and
capping the cost of insulin. And we can lower the cost of child and
elder care to help parents get back to work. I’ve done what I can on my
own to help working families during this challenging time—and will keep
acting to lower costs where I can—but now Congress needs to act
too.”</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>“Third, we need to keep reducing the federal deficit, which will
help ease price pressures. Last week the nonpartisan Congressional
Budget Office projected that the deficit will fall by $1.7 trillion this
year—the largest reduction in history. That will leave the deficit as a
share of the economy lower than prepandemic levels and lower than CBO
projected for this year before the American Rescue Plan passed. This
deficit progress wasn’t preordained. In addition to winding down
emergency programs responsibly, about half the reduction is driven by an
increase in revenue—as my economic policies powered a rapid
recovery.”</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><em>In other words:</em><br />
</li>
<li><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Blame the FED, Trump, Russia, and define the oil industry as
“autocrats” - the high inflation, it’s not Biden’s fault.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Reiterate that even though we continue to choose to sanction Russian
oil and gas, like Europe who’s <a
href="https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/vilches-europes-mad-ban-russian-oil">heading
towards</a> the largest energy shortfall in decades, forcing the public
to spend higher and higher percentages of their income on energy
(causing the especially vulnerable and elderly to literally freeze to
death if they can’t afford heat - a real and increasing problem) This is
framed as something we need to do it to ‘stick it to Putin.’ Next,
release all US strategic oil reserves to artificially bring down price -
temporarily, (this was <a
href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-strategic-petroleum-reserve-drops-lowest-level-since-1987-2022-05-16/">already
done</a>, reserves are now at decades long lows) then pass green energy
tax credits and spend more money to further investments in the space.
Then spend more money to fix supply chains and improve infrastructure.
Then begin “cracking down on the exorbitant fees that foreign ocean
freight companies charge to move products,” (here come the price
controls). Then build a million homes. Then give pharmaceutical
companies the ability to negotiate, but also “cap the cost of insulin.”
(There they are)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Reduce the federal deficit which is supposedly will contract by
$1.7T (That is, if we compare Year over year numbers to the last two
years when we printed more than 25% of M2 money supply, causing a
massive federal deficit, it’s easy to see how the “deficit shortfall”
will come down, even while net deficit will go up)</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Analysis:</em><br />
The problem is that despite the negative connotation, Biden is right -
Oil companies are autocrats, they have ultimate control over global
energy markets and thus the economies of the world, there are very few
things which are more important to our way of life than oil. A reduction
in production and consumption of oil and natural gas (or higher prices)
means more crop shortages, fertilizer shortages, supply chain issues,
mass starvation and malnutrition especially in the third world,
decreased economic activity globally, higher unemployment everywhere,
individual savings evaporate, wealth inequality is exacerbated, etc. We
need oil to run the world, and lots of it. Cheap oil makes everyone
better off.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if climate change were to enter the conversation, one
needs to ask; what is the carbon footprint of spending and sending 40
Billion to Ukraine in our funding of the newest proxy war started
immediately after the last. All thew way back in a 2011 interview,
Julian Assange <a
href="https://www.londontimes.live/state-of-affairs/julian-assange-speaking-in-2011-the-goal-is-an-endless-war-not-a-successful-war/">states</a>,
“The goal is to use Afghanistan to wash money out of the tax bases of
the US and Europe through Afghanistan and back into the hands of a
transnational security elite. The goal is an endless war, not a
successful war.” Nothing has changed, additionally, EV’s are nowhere
near cost effective enough for global transportation and they won’t be
so globally until at least the mid 2030’s when the majority of developed
nations have gone through a generation of EV cars and they can filter
through the used markets into developing nations. Green energy and
heating production is not efficient enough in most locations and won’t
be for some time, tax credits are nice incentives and it’s yet to be
seen if the average consumer will save $500/year on their energy bill as
Biden says. The rest of his plan involves spending more money that GDP
is not bringing in as we head into another negative quarter of growth,
which will thus increase the deficit. Inflation is always a monetary
phenomenon, spending more money will make inflation worse, not better.
The same goes for his previous plan mentioned above, every single line
item (many taken from build back better) will involve spending massive
amounts of money, multiple trillions, created by the Treasury, adding to
the federal deficit - which is the primary cause if inflation.</p>
<p>The way to solve consumer price inflation is to bolster the actual
GDP output of the economy, create more literal goods and services
without creating more dollars - More goods being chased by fewer dollars
drives inflation down. That’s the fun way, the alternative is demand
destruction by economic recession, if no one has money to buy anything,
demand also goes down. That’s unfortunately where we’re at while
simultaneously placing higher taxes and price controls on the very
producers who are capable of solving the problem (oil companies etc.)
While some of the proposals in the long run (decades) could bring down
inflation - now is not the time to increase deficit spending, the time
would have been when (real) GDP was strong, when interest rates and
(real yields) had already been (much) higher for years, spend when you
have the money, not when you don’t.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Conclusion</em><br />
Spending now only digs the grave of the debt driven deflationary spiral
deeper once it does arrive, we no longer have high interest rates as a
tool to combat inflation, the deficit is too high and will drive the US
to insolvency, but I imagine they intend to inflate the bubble a few
more times before that happens, the 2019 repo crisis is evidence enough
of that sentiment. It’s getting harder and harder to ignore the missteps
at every turn, and incompetence is often indistinguishable from
malice.</li>

<li><p>BTC playing catch up over the weekend, riskiest of risk assets
will lag. Eventual decoupling will result in BTC being risk off, but
this still seems like a distant future.</p></li>
<li><p>BTC Peak Fear and greed index recently reached 8 (now 10) -
Extreme fear, good long term buy indicator despite potential further
downside.</p></li>
<li><p>Alt/BTC pair is likely to continue to bleed until BTC shows
monthly strength, BTC maxi’s always have a good point.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Traditional markets are having a nice rally after solid support
at S&amp;P:3900, now above 4100. Still low call volume.</p></li>
<li><p>Volatility will likely remain high for several weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>Consumer savings accounts shredded, American’s are not able to
adjust spending to keep up with newly higher prices. - chart from Zero
hedge.</p></li>
<li><p>BTC Down, everything else up, correlation with risk is breaking,
but not in the fun direction. Price action closes hourly low below the
range low, Longs getting trimmed until clarity in PA. BTC is the most
risky of risk on assets, will potentially rally last under a bear market
rally.</p></li>
<li><p>BTC dominance likely to continue to stay flat or rise whether we
go up or down, Alts have been rekt with no end in sight, good prices,
but no strength in BTC means alts could drop another 60%+ from
here.</p></li>
<li><p>Lumber futures are down big at peak building season, houses
should be being built but no one’s buying wood, long term housing
shortage will continue until prices fall significantly.</p></li>
<li><p>NYT changes tune on Ukraine war - Ukraine can’t win. (While
typing I defaulted to writing “we can’t win” - American’s don’t want or
need another proxy war.)</p></li>
<li><p>Voter turnout hits record numbers in Georgia as Dems switch sides
leading to massive positive swing for Republicans, could foreshadow
future problems for Dems as many have already been forecasting,
potentially even more reason for a FED pivot prior to November.</p></li>

<p><em>5/25/2022</em> <br><br />
<strong>Short term outlook:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>DXY and US10YR threatening to roll over (a point for the bulls,
finally)</p></li>
<li><p>S&amp;P &amp; QQQ (&amp;BTC) looking at a bear market rally,
possibly 7-15% from bottom</p></li>
<li><p>BTC target 35k then possibly run the 25K lows if bottom falls out
of tradfi</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally 10 year falls for the right reason (inflation
expectations down) rather than the wrong reason (growth expectations
down)</p></li>
<li><p>Call option volume remains low, all markets still waiting for
buyers despite massively oversold conditions</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Longer term outlook:</strong><br />
Base case is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Possible bounce here</p></li>
<li><p>Possible lower lows after - lots of entities looking for exit
liquidity and a rotation out of growth to value and commodities for what
is potentially a commodity driven stagflationary supercycle - this would
not be great but it’s potentially unavoidable (though with more QE,
growth will come back as well)</p></li>
<li><p>Possible rally into November midterms,</p></li>
<li><p>Fed may sell Mortgage backed securities back into the market
despite rapid rise in rates, housing will take a hit regardless</p></li>
<li><p>Fed hiking could stop Q4 2022 (Currently market is pricing in
later 2023 or 2024 - but they won’t get that far) at which point when
the hiking stops, the low will already be in, markets are forward
looking and will recover far before the economy does.</p></li>
<li><p>Economy looking at higher unemployment, lower wage growth, higher
consumer credit to come, increased home sales and defaults, etc. real
stagflation driven mainly by monetary QE, but also sanctions, and supply
chains, all with no real painless solution that isn’t more governmental
jobs programs/Universal basic income/ socialized losses to subsidize
government errors etc.</p></li>
<li><p>They will try to inflate the long term debt bubble a few more
times before they let it pop and try to implement CBDC’s as the savior,
by this time BTC will be in the “early majority” stage of the adoption
curve and by enough people learning about the faults BTC corrects in the
monetary system, traditional finance will become fractured towards a
dual system solution, one forever inflating, one forever
deflating.</p></li>
</ul>

_________________________________________________________<br />
<strong>5/24/2022</strong> <br><br />
- Bear market rally in QQQ less obvious<br />
- Was Friday rally enough to calm these extreme oversold
conditions?<br />
- Larger uncertainty now<br />
- Still bullish on long term price trend and eventual FED pivot,
possibly before NOV midterms, but short term pain seems imminent</p>

- Possible bounce here, then we’ll see. Markets on edge, everything
oversold but still waiting for buyers.</p>
