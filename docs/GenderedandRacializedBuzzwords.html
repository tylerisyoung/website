<strong><em>Should I use the term LatinX?</em></strong>

<h3>
Gendered and Racialized Buzzwords
</h3>
<p>Should I use the term LatinX? <br></p>
<p>Should I use the term LatinX? The Activist might ask. My answer is
no, primarily because even <a
href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/many-latinos-say-latinx-offends-or-bothers-them-here-s-ncna1285916">mainstream
media outlets</a> like NBC say that it’s probably not a good idea.
Furthermore there was a recent study stating that of 800 registered
voters of Latin American descent, only 2% chose to describe themselves
as LatinX, but also that 40% of these same voters were <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/06/hispanic-voters-latinx-term-523776">actively
offended</a> by the term, and 30% would not support a politician or
organization using the term.</p>
<p>So why is this term still being advocated for and used? Because
virtue signaling has become a necessity of the woke left’s movement. For
those who aren’t interested in the following narrative and history
lesson; The only way to counter postmodernism is unfortunately with more
postmodernism: Is not the predominantly western and white insistence on
using the term Latinx simply another form of colonization and exclusion
via the English language i.e. Just another barrier to entry into a more
virtuous ingroup that actually in practice excludes the very people it
aims to help?</p>
<p>Similar to using “they” as a direct pronoun, LatinX just doesn’t work
for the invented problem it’s meant to be solving. The entire Spanish
language is gendered, and on top of that, <a
href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/06/hispanic-voters-latinx-term-523776">Politico</a>
even writes, “some Spanish speakers argue it’s tricky to know how to
pronounce LatinX in their native tongue”. So to the people arguing for
the use of this term, good luck living life thinking that an entire root
language it is something that needs to be changed or “fixed” and that
you know better. Terms like LatinX are not actually the end goal of the
organizers of the modern left, this is a weird and tangential symptom of
a larger problem, and why it’s important to discuss postmodernism for
what it is. Today’s Postmodernism is justified racism and sexism based
on the idea that governments, activists, and organizers know how to
better run society compared to the traditional free markets and merit
based enlightenment and scientific values.</p>
<p>Racial discrimination is actually making a comeback, though not in
the way you might think. Despite a multi decade long Democratic super
majority, California has not done much of anything to fix any of these
perceived social issues, and many of them are getting worse. The current
tactic among activists is to repeal things like Prop 209 which <a
href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_209,_Affirmative_Action_Initiative_(1996)">passed
in 1996</a>:</p>
<p><em>“A”yes” vote supported adding Section 31 to the California
Constitution’s Declaration of Rights, which said that the state cannot
discriminate against or grant preferential treatment on the basis of
race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of
public employment, public education, and public contracting.”</em></p>
<p>Social Justice activists in California actually want to repeal this
language - Allowing public employers to discriminate based on race.
Luckily prop 16 did not pass when it somehow made it onto the 2020
ballot. But this brings up a good question of why is discrimination
suddenly allowed in government entities?</p>
<p>Here is a recent example of Kamala Harris being purposefully racist
through the use of additional social justice buzzwords of Equality and
Equity, choosing to deliver hurricane relief aid and funds to victims in
Florida primarily <a
href="https://twitter.com/endwokeness/status/1575945239872737282">based
on race.</a></p>
<p>This is not an isolated incident; “<a
href="https://thepostmillennial.com/san-francisco-bicycle-coalitions-tells-members-not-to-report-stolen-bikes-because-it-hurts-black-and-brown-people">The
San Francisco Bicycle Coalition says not to call police about stolen
bikes because it hurts ‘black and brown’ people</a>,” ”</p>
<p>and it’s not only woke people and the people who they are trying to
help, but <a
href="https://twitter.com/tragicbirdapp/status/1545033499060707330?s=12">regular
everyday people</a> who don’t know what’s going on generally feel that
they need to <a
href="https://twitter.com/tragicbirdapp/status/1545107426751438850?s=12">change
their behaviors</a> in order to not be racist, sexist, transphobic, etc.
even going to sar as to suggest that <a
href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1539679020278767618">white
people should not go tanning</a> unless they are an “ally” to the
movement. This is a dangerous and society dividing ideology.</p>
<p>The terms Kamala Harris uses are very important to understand in
modern discourse. Equality; meaning equality of opportunity in a merit
based system, is what MLK was referring to when using the word in his I
Have a Dream speech famously saying,</p>
<p>“I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by
the content of their character.”</p>
<p>This speech took place in a time when equality under the law was
actually not existent. Today, these terms are <em>purposefully</em>
misused by the organizers of the many advocates and allies unbeknownst
to them, in order to mislead average people (who Lenin called ‘useful
idiots’) in order to achieve ‘Equity;’ meaning equality of outcome which
is to eliminate differential outcomes among racial or other marginalized
groups in society, hence the current focus on identity markers and
identity politics. It is important to remember; Differences in outcome
are not sufficient evidence of discrimination let alone actual
discrimination on the books as law. This type of legal discrimination
99% no longer exists in the western world, but many want to bring it
back which begs the question; why?</p>
<p>The modern use of ‘Equity’ is actually a term coming from Marx, and
Neo-Marxism from the <a
href="https://iep.utm.edu/critical-theory-frankfurt-school/">Frankfurt
school</a> in Germany where much of the new lefts ideas originate from
having turned traditional and largely economic Marxism into social
Marxism i.e. redefinition of power dynamics, ‘dialectic’ and ‘critique’
as a means of implementing simultaneously societal-bottom up ideologies
as well as economic-top down communism into the framework of Plato’s
centralized philosopher king philosophical model vs Aristotle’s
decentralized and personal enlightenment philosophical model as
explained in the 1971 book “Critical Theory Since Plato” by Hazard
Adams, which is of course <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Theory-Since-Plato-Hazard-dp-0155055046/dp/0155055046/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">available
on Amazon.</a>.</p>
<p>This dichotomy is stark, and critical theorists are now advocating
for ridding of society of unwanted and often unnoticed structural and
individual biases so that marginalized groups lived experienced are not
short changed. This is a commendable goal, and something the right often
dismisses while simply advocating for the pulling of bootstraps,
however, the methods currently being advocated for on the left at the
highest levels of government have now entered into the realm of cultural
hegemony. This was in fact expected by those standing against today’s
renewed racism hidden within critical theory. Now prominent figures like
top gender scholar Peter Boghossian have criticisms of critical theory
which prevent it from being advocated for seriously, or ethically. That
is in addition to James Lindsey and Helen Pluckrose who co authored
“Cynical Theories: How Activist Scholarship Made Everything About Race,
Gender and Identity – And Why This Harms Everybody” The book was in part
a chronicling of the famous stunt they pulled; passing off ridiculous
ideas like ‘dog parks perpetuate rape culture’ and direct Nazi ideology
as modern Social Justice publishing these ideas in several top academic
and peer reviewed journals proving that not only these ridiculous
assertions, but all subjective ideas and arguments are always correct to
the social justice movement given they advance the Critical Pedagogy
through ‘Praxis;’ The application and implementation of Critical Theory
to education and society.</p>
<p>This is how the left can continue to claim that ‘Critical Theory’ is
not taught in k-12 schools, and they would be correct, though the Praxis
of Critical Theory is clear and universally pervasive as California
again is officially suggesting that math classes <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/04/us/california-math-curriculum-guidelines.html">should</a>
“use lessons to explore social justice,” in order to solve their problem
of having some of the nations lowest standardized test scores in math,
this is similar to <a
href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/06/07/fairness-means-lowering-bar-education-column/673198002/">New
York’s</a> reserving 20% of schools admissions for minority students
This is all because equity is necessary to advocate for everywhere. This
is where classical liberals and the left writ-large fail to understand
the new and growing faction of the woke left; This is why people are <a
href="https://twitter.com/RealDSchmidt/status/1538935032571744256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1538935218228367360%7Ctwgr%5E5bcf4fd40e87694d97abc496617d0b22b2779196%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.systems%2Fembed%2FaHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9yZWFsZHNjaG1pZHQvc3RhdHVzLzE1Mzg5MzUyMTgyMjgzNjczNjA%2Fcz0xMg%3D%3D">defecting
from the left in record numbers</a>, because these arguments are not
about the ideas, they are about the Praxis, the implementation of the
ideas within society, not arguing about what’s best. The end goal of
equity of outcome has already been decided.</p>
<p>In order to make this utopia a reality, actual racism is necessary
and widely <a
href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1537827426255917060?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1537827426255917060%7Ctwgr%5E7a20942f4436fdc43a4e68ebaba6417160bf917d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.systems%2Fembed%2FaHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9saWJzb2Z0aWt0b2svc3RhdHVzLzE1Mzc4Mjc0MjYyNTU5MTcwNjA%2Fcz0xMg%3D%3D">accepted</a>
among allies not only as justified, but the right thing to do.</p>
<p>To be clear, <a
href="https://twitter.com/ampol_moment/status/1532089724680085504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1532089724680085504%7Ctwgr%5E660840cdfb09902939a02ec8e19ee8bc4a09fa87%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.systems%2Fembed%2FaHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9hbXBvbF9tb21lbnQvc3RhdHVzLzE1MzIwODk3MjQ2ODAwODU1MDQ%2Fcz0xMg%3D%3D">this
is what actual racism looks like</a>.</p>
<p>This slow and grinding change of societal values is done via
subversion of dialectic via new definitions, new terms, and new meanings
purposefully meant to drive the creation of ingroups and outgroups, from
textbook critical theory and praxis. These are exactly the methods of
Mao’s youth movement targeting their elders to subvert from the bottom
up i.e. ‘grassroots movements’ who demand things like ‘ESG accounting
principles’ because ‘Climate Change is the biggest problem of our time’
and that it is such an ‘existential issue’ it both necessitates and
requires simultaneously Lennin’s top down approach. This is how we’ve
recently seen the shared ideology and partnerships of grassroot
activists with corporate and public-private partnerships which abandon
traditional capitalistic values in favor of governmental stakeholder
values, and therefore forced equity reflected mandatory compliance with
such manipulated narratives.</p>
<p>This is how and why ‘critical theory’ or ‘Praxis’ is so important to
fully understand at the root level because its these changing
definitions which matter most; from ‘justice’ to ‘social justice’ to
which now means fairness in (outcomes) of society rather than fairness
under the law, and obviously this would mean ‘inclusion’ should take
precedence over merit based approaches to help achieve the equality of
outcome in the first place, because it’s not about the best outcomes
(merit or profits or equal opportunity and treatment under the law, but
it’s about the most representative outcomes for the new stakeholders who
are implementing (top down) actions which cannot be inequitable.
i.e. ‘equality of outcome’, (trimming the tall grass) so that no one is
marginalized or oppressed - because these organizations like the UN, the
WEF, governments etc. definitely cannot be responsible for any top down
approaches that result in inequality. They’ve forgotten that differences
in outcome are not sufficient evidence of discrimination.</p>
<p>Marx said, “it ought to have been said that with the abolition of
class distinctions all social and political inequality arising from them
would disappear of itself.” Now replace class with race or gender. This
is why representation is supposedly so important across all genders,
races and identities - because once that is achieved, racism will
disappear.</p>
<p>Advocates of critical race theory like Kendi and De Angelo are
directly citing Kimberly Crenshaw, Herbert Marcuse, Kissinger, and
others who were living at a time and writing in a world when no one had
any idea that millions were dying in Russia, China and Cambodia where
these ideas were actually being implemented, these places were seen as
(ongoing) great success stories and applauded at the time by
postmodernists and a litany of French philosophers like Kant and
Foucault who are so often referenced by everyone who promotes these
postmodern concepts.</p>
<p>Finally, California <a
href="https://reason.com/2021/05/04/california-math-framework-woke-equity-calculus/">is
now holding back</a> students who are gifted at math, keeping students
learning at the same levels for as long as possible, this is precisely
what Pol Pot carried out in the Marxist based Cambodian genocide
inspired by the Cultural Revolution in China though ended up targeting
the Chinese living in Cambodia. As Dan Carlin from Hardcore history
podcast details, The Khmer Group and Pol Pot himself wanted a
subsistence based society based on equality meaning they had the power
and incentive to go the furthest any society has gone toward
implementing the final stages of equality of outcome, they wanted
everyone to be the same; The killing started with wealthy individuals
with ties to the west, but continued to include intellectuals who often
opposed these ideas, then it expanded yet again to include anyone who
wore glasses which implied that they had an education which most of the
population did not, therefore they were considered enemies of the
agrarian movement, and finally it was anyone that stood out for any
reason which they could then be considered to be a counter
revolutionary, a horrible scar on the face of humanity, it was “the
revenge of the ignorant over the educated.”- Henri Locard</p>
<p>For authors writing in the 60’s, their praising of equality of
outcome is nearly excusable; they had no idea of the atrocities
happening in Cambodia to make this nightmare a reality, but those who
advocate for these ideas today like Kamala Harris, or Ibram X Kendi, <a
href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/08/06/oprah-winfrey-ibram-x-kendi-discuss-maya-angelou-amy-cooper/3313467001/">Oprah</a>,
and many many more ignore this until confronted when they use sophistry
to dismiss and derail arguments or refuse to debate anyone on the
issues, because their ideas are not about correctness in morals, ethics,
or their consequences, but are performed through Praxis to achieve
equality of outcome.</p>
<p>Gendered and racialized buzzwords are often hiding an ideology which
cannot be seen or heard, but one that is being quietly implemented
across all facets of society because it appears to be the right thing to
do. Sometimes it is right, but most of the time it is the left, and we
need to make the distinction between the left and the new left who would
like to implement social Marxism in the US like the <a
href="https://nypost.com/2020/06/25/blm-co-founder-describes-herself-as-trained-marxist/">founders
of Black lives Matter</a>.</p>
