<strong>Distributed Idea Suppression Complex</strong>

<h3>
Is information disseminated fairly?
</h3>
<p><br> Universities, institutions, and the academic journals are
playing the same bureaucratic institutional role that mainstream news
organizations are; Suppressing new ideas in favor of tenure tracks,
published research, and a cheap labor force doing the highest caliber
work in the form of workers who are not tied into the distributed
network of mainstream enforcement. Those who are detached include up and
coming PHD students, blue collar workers, independent journalists, eager
start up entrepreneurs, and the like, being largely the only ones
capable of producing original thoughts, ideas, and solving problems in
novel ways. They continue their paths thanklessly only to have their
concerns silenced, shot down, and canceled, while their best original
thoughts and ideas are stolen from under them and taken credit for by
the established institutional players. This is not a new phenomenon.</p>
<p>Dr Eric Weinstein coined the term <a
href="https://medium.com/@josephparrish/encountering-the-disc-in-democratic-party-da7df9efd7aa">Distributed
Idea Suppression Complex</a> the (DISC) has arisen and has a competitive
advantage in every major society and sector until this phenomenon is
either corrected to a mode that benefits a majority of society, or
destroyed. The only downfall of the amorphous driving force of the DISC
may come from public uprising; Unions and grad students on strike,
political corruption that’s become too blatant to ignore, war, or
depending on how you view it, the unnerving, or inevitable rise of
former president Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Over the last 50 years we have seen an unprecedented shift from the
traditional economic bell curve of wealth distribution to more of a
negatively skewing, bottom weighted Lorenz curve of economic inequality
where the 1% thrive. This is not inherently bad, nor unexpected, but has
negative consequences when it’s reinforced by corruption and politicians
who not only favor the elite, but who are the elite. This influence can
then be used to manipulate what should be free market capitalism with
delicate regulation and has lead us to a place many call <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_capitalism">late stage
capitalism</a>. Our elected representatives are openly corrupt, Nanci
Pelosi is the third richest individual in Congress with a net worth of
$120 million from a salary of $223k/ year. In addition to her salary
over her 18 years in congress, she outperformed the market by a factor
of 10 averaging 27% per year doing better than Warren Buffet
himself.</p>
<p>There have recently been <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/03/20/senators-accused-of-insider-trading-dumping-stocks-after-coronavirus-briefings/#31ff28b94a45">accusations</a>
of insider trading in congress, but this is nothing new considering the
house speaker’s <a
href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/congress-trading-stock-on-inside-information/">precedent</a>
of great stock picks: 5000 shares of VISA which she just so happened to
buy while legislation that would have hurt credit card companies was
likely to pass in the house, after her purchases were made public, the
stock jumped an unprecedented 68% in two days, and the bill never made
it to the floor.</p>
<p>Our institutions are objectively corrupt, and the incentive
structures of the DISC perpetuate this corruption out in the open, only
to be later justified and greenwashed by the media and useful idiots.
This is why a majority of Americans do not vote, or refuse to
participate. This is also why it lands when people like Donald Trump
called the democrats corrupt and calls out the fake news. We can’t
pretend it’s not there on both sides, but I think Donald Trump made a
great litmus test for objectivity.</p>
<p>I was not around for the mystical Clinton years, but I refuse to
believe that Joe Biden and the modern democratic party are Jesus
reincarnate. While living in California, I have been “accused” of being
a Republican as if vote shaming someone was ever a good thing, so I will
also add that I do not believe anyone, especially a leader, should ever
be as brazen and crass as Trump was, no one should lie so much about
anything let alone things which don’t even matter, he should not have
been overtly racist, he should stop getting fake tans etc. etc. but my
position is that; Trump was the best example i’ve seen of the DISC in
action when it came to things like the false narratives of <a
href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/the-russiagate-whitewash-era-begins?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo4Nzc1MjUyLCJfIjoiUk1OMU0iLCJpYXQiOjE2MzgxNzAyMTksImV4cCI6MTYzODE3MzgxOSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTEwNDIiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.RFCpH47ca_L0TI7DuHBgeCdBUrK376PaUBbl32Xd7gM">Russiagate</a>,
<a
href="https://www.sgtreport.com/2019/11/the-real-story-behind-ukrainegate/">Ukrainegate</a>,
and the majority of his presidency which was lies on all sides which
were easy to see if you don’t pledge allegiance to one side or the
other.</p>
<p>Similar false narratives are present within the Covid lab leak
hypothesis, at first those who even mentioned it were called <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/06/03/the-wuhan-lab-leak-hypothesis-is-a-conspiracy-theory-not-science/">conspiracy
theorists</a>, even <a
href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/06/the-lab-leak-theory-is-unbearably-racist/">racists</a>.
Now it is<a
href="https://unherd.com/2021/08/did-the-new-york-times-stifle-lab-leak-debate/">widely
accepted</a> that it is one possible origin of many, though at this time
I believe that there is <a
href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/10/the-lab-leak-theory-is-now-almost-certainly-proved-and-other-commentary/">sufficient</a>
and continually emerging <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/08/25/coronavirus-origin-report-/">evidence</a>
and <a
href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/more-evidence-that-the-wuhan-lab-leak-theory-is-the-correct-one/ar-BB1gtFWK">shifting
narrative</a> spear headed by Yuri Deigin’s initial <a
href="https://yurideigin.medium.com/lab-made-cov2-genealogy-through-the-lens-of-gain-of-function-research-f96dd7413748">report</a>
which suggests that a lab leak would be not only the Occam’s razor
conclusion, but is provably the only possible origin of Sars Cov-2. This
of course will never be confirmed or publicly shared by any major news
networks, or even by governments continually worried about international
push back, because the DISC in all its forms buries inconvenient truths
despite how much harm they may cause. Could lives have been saved if we
focused on facts instead of censorship and manipulation?</p>
<p>Neither the left or the right, nor Trump nor Biden is the root of the
problem, corrupt politicians are a symptom of the problem. The problem
is in part a financial one as explained by <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">Chomsky</a>,
but it is also a philosophical one. We need an exit from our now
entrenched us vs. them mentality, our identity politics and our newly
adopted woke culture wars cannot sustain. Yes, we need to trust the
science, but we also need to ensure that media and academic institutions
are not self censoring the science for political reasons.</p>
<p>In the British Medical Journal, an opinion piece titled “<a
href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/06/02/political-censorship-in-academic-journals-sets-a-dangerous-new-precedent/">Political
censorship in academic journals sets a dangerous new precedent</a>”
details the political nature of a choice Lancet made to retract the
authors paper warning of Covid on the war torn Gaza strip before the
virus had spread worldwide. Physicians from the U.S. and elsewhere
demanded to Lancet that they remove the BMJ’s article from their
database and Lancet complied, explaining to BMJ that they “could not
sustain yet another campaign of this nature.”</p>
<p>The same can be said for censorship campaigns in the name of
combating misinformation on social media, facebook was forced to <a
href="https://munrkazmir.medium.com/censorship-of-covid-lab-leak-theory-humiliates-social-media-giants-c50727db8b73">retract</a>
their ban of any mentions of the lab leak hypothesis, twitter
implimented a controversial misinformation <a
href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/twitter-rolls-redesigned-misinformation-warning-labels-81212172">label</a>
and YouTube is rather <a
href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/youtube-bans-frontline-doctors-speech-criticizing-experimental-agent-covid-vaccine/">liberal</a>
with their permanent banning policy towards actual doctors with
different opinions. Even if these doctors in question were wrong on
their analysis, how and when did social media companies determine that
they know better then practicing clinicians? Do these companies have
teams of medical researchers determining what is or isn’t
misinformation? They certainly don’t simply go off of what the CDC’s
official policy is as evidenced by Dr. Pierre Cory’s testimony to
congress on the official US government Youtube channel being <a
href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/youtube-remove-doctor-senate-testimony-coronavirus-ron-johnson-big-tech">taken
down</a> without explication. The subject of the testimony was at the
time regarding a cheap, off the shelf, and widely available drug which
was potentially useful in the treatment of covid, Ivermectin. The
testimony was prior to the CDC having any guidelines regarding the drug,
therefore YouTube apparently bases its censorship decisions on some
other internal policy which we are unable to know, similar to the
algorithms of many major social media platforms.</p>
<p>The same thing occurred to popular outsiders running in the 2020
election, the <a
href="https://vocal.media/theSwamp/a-visual-history-of-the-yang-media-blackout">Yang</a>
media blackout was apparent and similar to the <a
href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5772836/tulsi-gabbard-media-blackout/">Tulsi</a>
Media Blackout all of which are <a
href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/460224-why-the-media-dislike-andrew-tulsi-bernie-and-marianne">explained</a>
by The Hill. Our very own institutions are clinging to power with every
trick in the book, and with the recent pervasiveness of social media, we
can see the corruption blatantly.</p>
<p>The NY Post, a now conservative outlet ,was founded by Alexander
Hamilton in 1801, today it holds the title of the Nations oldest
newspaper. The paper had its official, verified account banned from
twitter for breaking a story regarding Hunter Biden’s Laptop. Twitter
also depopulated posts and placed misinformation tags below any mentions
of the laptop. Facebook did the same. The images were leaked and the
story turned out weeks later to be true. The Bidens have to this day not
denied the laptops existence or contents, however was rarely discussed
by other outlets because the DISC favors silence when it comes to those
inconvenient truths. Only weeks before the election, it could be argued
this act of censorship may have changed the course of history.</p>
<p>Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has recently resigned and appointed the CEO
Parag Arawal who said regarding free speech, “Our role is not to be
bound by the First Amendment, but our role is to serve a healthy public
conversation and our moves are reflective of things that we believe lead
to a healthier public conversation. The kinds of things that we do about
this is, focus less on thinking about free speech, but thinking about
how the times have changed. One of the changes today that we see is
speech is easy on the internet. Most people can speak. Where our role is
particularly emphasized is who can be heard.” With this ominous
attitude, Arawal alludes to a world were the constitution and freedom of
the press does not hold any water online.</p>
<p>In his first day as CEO, Arawal announced in a <a
href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/private-information-policy-update">blog
post</a> that Twitter would be implementing a new policy which prevents
people from sharing photos and videos of other people without their
consent if the images are intended to harass, or intimidate them. A
twitter review team will assess whether the context and images violate
the terms and conditions. The company claims that the policy is meant to
protect people from physical or emotional harm. Emotional harm is real
harm caused by real violence, and according to Berkeley <a
href="https://twitter.com/SophiaLeeHyun/status/908506014038630400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E908506014038630400%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwelovetrump.com%2F2020%2F06%2F13%2Faccording-to-the-left-speech-and-silence-are-both-violence%2F">students</a>,
and much of the woke left; “Speech is violence” and problematic speech
must also be banned.</p>
<p>The claim that Donald Trump incited violence with this specific tweet
on January 6th got him banned from Twitter as <a
href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221386/twitter-employees-trump-ban-internal-letter-capitol-attack">demanded</a>
by hundreds twitter employees.</p>
<p>This was all happening while the official Taliban <a
href="https://twitter.com/Zabehulah_M33">account</a> remains active
bragging about their wars waged across Afghanistan and inciting violence
against women. The problem with this type of enforcement is that it can
never be objective.</p>
<p>Many fail to realize that this is exactly the aim, to remove
objectivity, and allow those with institutional power to set the
narrative based on whatever reparations they deem necessary based on a
racist culture scorecard of oppression, whoever is most oppressed gets
precedent, this is how the “black lives matter” turned into “black trans
lives matter”</p>
<p>This phrasing becomes worrisome when emotional harm can only be
inferred. Furthermore we are increasingly seeing the so called woke
portion of the democratic party claiming that “speech is violence” and
comparing</p>
<p>Many conservatives argue that the tech giants are private companies
with no obligations towards free speech and can therefore police their
platforms however they desire. This argument however cannot
simultaneously be used while these same platforms are protected under <a
href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45650">Section
230</a> which prevents civil or criminal lawsuits against them for what
is posted on their platforms. It is also highly problematic when press
secretary Jen Psaki says that the Biden administration is “<a
href="https://www.thenationalsentinel.com/2021/07/15/jen-psaki-admits-that-yes-the-biden-regime-is-working-with-facebook-social-media-to-flag-content/">working
with</a>” social media companies to determine what content is flagged as
misinformation.</p>
<p>This behavior is unacceptable especially when the timely spread of
information could save thousands, or millions of lives, a bright and
shining example of constructive policy was demonstrated by Medrxiv and
other pre-print medical journal servers who in the early days of the
pandemic open sourced all of their soon to be published works. The
entire website came with an inherent disclaimer of: These papers are
pending peer review, so they should be taken with a grain of salt. The
public should be treated as if they are capable of critical thinking and
rationality, rather than a herd of sheep in need of coddling.</p>
<p>Ultimately we need corruption and perverse incentive structures out
of our politics and academic institutions. Until this occurs, we need
free to strike a balance that is very near to speech across social
platforms so that we may collectively advocate against those very same
incentives which drive the false narrative conversations. It will save
lives both right now, and into the future.</p>
<p>The structural and financial problems in the media will need to be
dealt with, but for now it is important that the average person knows
that there is more to the news than just the fairway of mainstream
information. The mainstream news will not dive into the weeds because it
gets too complex and nuanced for a five minute news segment far too
quickly. Therefore social media needs to remain the testing ground for
information dissemination, free, and open to discussing problems that
can then filter into a wider fairway of mainstream ideas, and solutions
without fear of cancellation or censorship. When we as a society fear to
speak out or are otherwise prevented from doing so, we are inevitably
helping the DISC manufacture consent.</p>
<p>Neither the government or private companies should be the arbiters of
truth, truth is derived through decentralized consensus mechanisms that
facilitate the scientific method of understanding where hypotheses
become models and experiments which can then be replicated, those
replicated studies provide information which can become a widely
distributed theory, and if proven to be correct, a theory can become
fact.</p>
<p>I may be wrong, I hope that I am wrong, but I am afraid that I am
not. We need to fight for whatever truths we have, we need to retain our
open access to the internet, to a censorship free world without
coercion, and to a world which strives for equal opportunity regardless
of politics, and despite diverse circumstances.</p>
