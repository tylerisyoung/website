<p><br> 2001 Hannuksela &amp; Ellahham - “<a
href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002934300006719">Benefits
and Risks of Sauna Bathing</a>”</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Lung Congestion</em></strong> - “Sauna bathing
decreases pulmonary congestion and increases the vital capacity, tidal
volume, minute ventilation, and forced expiratory volume of the lungs
(9,62). Patients with asthma or chronic bronchitis report that sauna
bathing improves their breathing (62). Twelve patients with obstructive
pulmonary disease who took sauna as a part of their rehabilitation
program also demonstrated improved lung function (63).”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Hypertension</em></strong> - “Winterfeld et al
(29,30,44) investigated the effects of regular sauna bathing on blood
pressure and found that a 3-month period of biweekly sauna bathing
lowered mean blood pressure from 166/101 to 143/92 mm Hg in 46
hypertensive patients (44) and from 162/110 to 139/92 mm Hg in 180
patients (29). Similar results were seen after a 3-year period (30).
However, these studies were not randomized, and patient selection
criteria were not described.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Heart Failure</em></strong> - “Chronic Heart Failure
Sauna generally has been contraindicated for patients with chronic heart
failure. However, sauna was well tolerated and improved hemodynamics in
patients with chronic heart failure after a single sauna exposure in 32
patients (49) and after a 4-week period of sauna bathing (5 days per
week) in 56 patients (50). Left ventricularejection fraction increased
from 24% 6 7% to 31% 6 9% and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension
decreased from 66 6 6mmto626 5 mm after the 4-week period (50). The
sauna used in these investigations was not a typical (Finnish) sauna but
an experimental infrared-ray dry sauna in which the temperature was
relatively low (608C), and the patients stayed in the supine position.
Larger randomized studies need to be performed to confirm the
findings.”</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br> 2018 Hussain &amp; Cohen - “<a
href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2018/1857413/">Clinical
Effects of Regular Dry Sauna Bathing: A Systematic review</a>”</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Systematic Review</em></strong> - “Many health
benefits are claimed by individuals and facilities promoting sauna
bathing; however the medical evidence to support these claims is not
well established. This paper aims to systematically review recent
research on the effects of repeated dry sauna interventions on human
health. Methods. A systematic search was made of medical databases for
studies reporting on the health effects of regular dry sauna bathing on
humans from 2000 onwards”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Discussion</em></strong> - ”
Thefindingsofthisreviewsuggest frequent dry sauna bathing improves a
variety of subjective and objective health parameters and that frequent
Finnish sauna bathing is associated with improved outcomes such as
reduced overall mortality and reduced incidence of cardiovascular events
and dementia, at least in men [38, 39]. The most established clinical
benefits of sauna bathing are associated with cardiovascular disease,
yet there is also evidence to suggest that saunas, either Finnish-style
or infrared, may benefit people with rheumatic diseases such as
fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, as well
as patients with chronic fatigue and pain syndromes, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and allergic rhinitis. Sauna bathing may also improve
exercise performance in athletes, skin moisture barrier properties, and
quality of life and is not associated with serious adverse events. There
is not yet enough evidence to distinguish any particular health
differences between repeat Finnish-style and repeat infrared sauna
bathing.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong> - “Regular infrared and/or
Finnish sauna bathing has the potential to provide many beneficial
health effects, especially for those with cardiovascular-related and
rheumatological disease, as well as athletes seeking improved exercise
performance. The mechanisms for these effects may include increased
bioavailability of NO (nitric oxide) to vascular endothelium, heat shock
protein-mediated metabolic activation, immune and hormonal pathway
alterations, enhanced excretions of toxicants through increased
sweating, and other hormetic stress responses.”</p></li>

proteins and heat therapy for type 2 diabetes: pros and cons</a>”</p>
<p>(Sauna &amp; Hot tub)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Heat Shock Proteins</em></strong> - “Heat therapy is
a promising and inexpensive tool for the treatment of obesity and
diabetes. We proposed that transient increments in nitric oxide and heat
shock protein 70 levels may explain the benefits of heat therapy. We
suggest that heat therapy (sauna: 80–1008C; hot tub: at 408C) for 15
min, three times a week, for 3 months, is a safe method to test its
efficiency.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Risk Factors</em></strong> - “People with
hypertension are commonly warned to check with a physician before using
a hot tub, but there is little literature on which to base this advice.
However, there are some cardiovascular contraindications for the use of
heat therapy, such as severe aortic stenosis, unstable angina pectoris,
recent myocardial infarction, decompensated heart failure, and cardiac
arrhythmia [1]. Finally, in people with diabetes and using insulin
administration, heat therapy may induce the risk of ketoacidosis [1]
because plasma concentrations of several counter-regulatory hormones,
including growth hormone and glucagon, are increased by exposure to
hyperthermia [1] and the risk of hypoglycemia due to enhanced insulin
absorption [1].”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Conclusions &amp; Suggestions</em></strong> - “Heat
therapy is a promising and inexpensive tool for the treatment of obesity
and diabetes. We proposed that transient increments in nitric oxide and
heat shock protein 70 levels may explain the benefits of heat therapy.
We suggest that heat therapy (sauna: 80–10C; hot tub: at 40C) for 15
min, three times a week, for 3 months, is a safe method to test its
efficiency.” <br> 2006 Kukkonen-Harjula &amp; Katriina - “<a
href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/ijch.v65i3.18102">Health
effects and risks of sauna bathing</a>”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Risks</em></strong> - “Sauna was well tolerated and
posed no health risks to healthy people from childhood to old age. Baths
did not appear to be particularly risky to patients with hypertension,
coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure, when they were
medicated and in a stable condition. Excepting toxemia cases, no adverse
effects of bathing during pregnancy were found, and baths were not
teratogenic. In musculoskeletal disorders, baths may relieve pain.
Medication in general was of no concern during a bath, apart from
antihypertensive medication, which may predispose to orthostatic
hypotension after bathing.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Improvements post heart failure</em></strong> - “A
further study compared the effects of two weeks’ sauna bathing in
patients with cardiac failure (28). Endothelium-mediated vasodilation
was enhanced, in addition to a decreased left ventricular end-diastolic
dimension and decreased circulating concentrations of brain natriuretic
peptide. Symptoms were improved in most patients (2). An improvement in
impaired vascular endothelial function after two weeks’ bathing was also
seen in men with cardiovascular risk factors, but without cardiac
failure (29). In a randomized controlled study, patients with heart
failure underwent sauna bathing on five days weekly for 2 weeks (30).
Compared with the non-treated group, premature ventricular contractions
decreased and heart rate variability increased, which might have
prognostic significance.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Depression</em></strong> - “here is some recent
Japanese evidence that sauna bathing might be beneficial in depressed,
or fatigued persons. In a randomized controlled study, non-obese
patients with mild depression underwent sauna-like exposure on five days
weekly for two weeks (35). Compared with the control group, somatic
complaints, hunger and relaxation scores improved, while concentrations
of plasma ghrelin, an orexigenic hormone, and daily energy intake,
increased.”</p></li>

<p><br> 2018 Laukkanen - “<a
href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(18)30275-1/fulltext">Cardiovascular
and Other Health Benefits of Sauna Bathing: A Review of the
Evidence</a>”</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong> - “Sauna bathing, an
activity that has been a tradition in Finland for thousands of years and
mainly used for the purposes of pleasure and relaxation, is becoming
increasingly popular in many other populations. Emerging evidence
suggests that beyond its use for pleasure, sauna bathing may be linked
to several health benefits, which include reduction in the risk of
vascular diseases such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease,
and neurocognitive diseases; nonvascular conditions such as pulmonary
diseases; mortality; as well as amelioration of conditions such as
arthritis, headache, and flu. The beneficial effects of sauna bathing on
these outcomes have been linked to its effect on circulatory,
cardiovascular, and immune functions. It has been postulated that
regular sauna bathing may improve cardiovascular function via improved
endothelium-dependent dilatation, reduced arterial stiffness, modulation
of the autonomic nervous system, beneficial changes in circulating lipid
profiles, and lowering of systemic blood pressure.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Article Highlights</em></strong> - “Finnish sauna
bathing, which is characterized by exposure to high environmental
temperature (80C-100C) for a brief period, has traditionally been used
for the purposes of pleasure and relaxation. / Beyond pleasure and
relaxation, emerging evidence suggests that sauna bathing has several
health benefits, which include reduction in the risk of vascular
diseases such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease (CVD),
stroke, and neurocognitive diseases; nonvascular conditions such as
pulmonary diseases including common flu; mortality; treatment of
specific skin conditions; as well as pain in conditions such as
rheumatic diseases and headache. / The physiological responses produced
by an ordinary sauna bath correspond to those produced by moderate- or
high-intensity physical activity such as walking. / The beneficial
effects of sauna baths on CVD and mortality may be mediated via
reduction in blood pressure, improvement in endothelial function,
reduction in oxidative stress and inflammation, beneficial modulation of
the autonomic nervous system, improved lipid profile and arterial
compliance, and improvement in the cardiorespiratory system. / Sauna
bathing is a safe activity and can even be used in patients with stable
CVD, provided it is used sensibly for an appropriate period of
time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Neurodegenerative Prevention</em></strong> -
“Neurocognitive Disease The etiology of neurocognitive disease is
multifactorial, with impaired cardiovascular function, inflammation, and
oxidative stress postulated as being major contributors in its
pathogenesis in addition to high systemic BP with elevated levels of
common cardiovascular risk factors.20,21 Emerging recent evidence
suggests that sauna exposure may have protective effects on
neurocognitive disease. In a population-based prospective cohort study
by Laukkanen et al16 conducted in 2315 apparently healthy Finnish men
aged 42 to 60 years at baseline, men who had 4 to 7 sauna sessions/wk
compared with those who had 1 sauna session/wk had a 66% and 65% reduced
risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease, respectively. Whether sauna
exposure exerts its neurocognitive protective effects via mediation in
the pathways contributing to these diseases or it is just an enjoyable
activity that prevents or delays the development of these memory
diseases is not clearly understood.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Other Health Benefits</em></strong> - Sauna bathing
has been linked to an improvement in pain and symptoms associated with
musculoskeletal disorders such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,
and fibromyalgia.25,26 Having sauna baths also improves headache
disorders. In an RCT by Kanji et al,27 37 people with chronic
tension-type headache were randomized to regular sauna bathing or advice
and education for a period of 8 weeks, and sauna therapy was found to
substantially improve headache intensity. Although there is some
evidence from a Japanese study that thermal therapy improved the
symptoms of patients with mild depression,28 to our knowledge, no study
has as yet reported the effects of Finnish sauna bathing on depression.
However, we have recently shown that men who had 4 to 7 sauna
sessions/wk had a 78% reduced risk of developing psychosis in the future
as compared with men who had only 1 sauna session/wk (J.A. Laukkanen,
PhD, unpublished data, February 7, 2018).”</p></li>

<p><br> 2018 Laukkanen - “<a
href="http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10654-017-0335-y">Sauna bathing
and systemic inflammation</a>”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Chronic Inflammation</em></strong> - “We aimed to
investigate whether frequency of sauna bathing is associated with the
levels of serum C-reactive protein. C-reactive protein is a leading
blood marker of systemic inflammation. The study consisted of 2084 men
(42–60 years) without acute or chronic inflammation. A total of 533
(25.6%), 1368 (65.6%), and 183 (8.8%) participants reported having a
sauna bath once a week, 2–3 times, and 4–7 times per week; mean serum
C-reactive protein levels were 2.41 (standard deviation 2.91), 2.00
(2.41), 1.65 (1.63) mmol/L, respectively. In a multivariable analysis
adjusted for baseline age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure,
smoking, type 2 diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, and serum low
density lipoprotein cholesterol, alcohol consumption and physical
activity, there was a significant inverse association between the
frequency of sauna bathing and the level of C-reactive protein…This
cross-sectional study suggests that sauna bathing, an activity which
promotes relaxation and well-being, may be a recommendable public health
intervention related to the reduced levels of systemic inflammatory
markers.”</li>
</ul>
<p><br> 2015 Laukkanen et al. - “<a
href="http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.8187">Association
Between Sauna Bathing and Fatal Cardiovascular and All-Cause Mortality
Events</a>”</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Objective</em></strong> - “To investigate the
association of frequency and duration of sauna bathing with the risk of
sudden cardiac death (SCD), fatal coronary heart disease (CHD), fatal
cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all-cause mortality.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Design</em></strong> - “We performed a prospective
cohort study (Finnish Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study)
of a population-based sample of 2315 middle-aged (age range, 42-60
years) men from Eastern Finland. Baseline examinations were conducted
from March 1, 1984, through December 31, 1989.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Results</em></strong> - “During a median follow-up of
20.7 years (interquartile range, 18.1-22.6 years), 190 SCDs, 281 fatal
CHDs, 407 fatal CVDs, and 929 all-cause mortality events occurred. A
total of 601, 1513, and 201 participants reported having a sauna bathing
session 1 time per week, 2 to 3 times per week, and 4 to 7 times per
week, respectively. The numbers (percentages) of SCDs were 61 (10.1%),
119 (7.8%), and 10 (5.0%) in the 3 groups of the frequency of sauna
bathing. The respective numbers were 89 (14.9%), 175 (11.5%), and 17
(8.5%) for fatal CHDs; 134 (22.3%), 249 (16.4%), and 24 (12.0%) for
fatal CVDs; and 295 (49.1%), 572 (37.8%), and 62 (30.8%) for all-cause
mortality events. After adjustment for CVD risk factors, compared with
men with 1 sauna bathing session per week, the hazard ratio of SCD was
0.78 (95% CI, 0.57-1.07) for 2 to 3 sauna bathing sessions per week and
0.37 (95% CI, 0.18-0.75) for 4 to 7 sauna bathing sessions per week (P
for trend = .005). Similar associations were found with CHD, CVD, and
all-cause mortality (P for trend .005). Compared with men having a sauna
bathing session of less than 11 minutes, the adjusted hazard ratio for
SCD was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.67-1.28) for sauna bathing sessions of 11 to 19
minutes and 0.48 (95% CI, 0.31-0.75) for sessions lasting more than 19
minutes (P for trend = .002); significant inverse associations were also
observed for fatal CHDs and fatal CVDs (P for trend .03) but not for
all-cause mortality events.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Conclusions</em></strong> - “Increased frequency of
sauna bathing is associated with a reduced risk of SCD, CHD, CVD, and
all-cause mortality. Further studies are warranted to establish the
potential mechanism that links sauna bathing and cardiovascular
health.”</p></li>
